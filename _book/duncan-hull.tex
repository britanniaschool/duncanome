Hello and welcome to the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{Department of Computer Science} at the \href{https://www.manchester.ac.uk}{University of Manchester}. My name is Duncan and I'm a lecturer here with responsibility for managing our \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/}{Industrial Experience} (IE) program. This elective course has \protect\hyperlink{employability}{around 100} students every year working in paid employment for the penultimate (``sandwich'') year-in-industry of their undergraduate degrees. 🥪🎓

I \protect\hyperlink{teaching}{teach} undergraduate \& postgraduate courses, supervise tutorials \& projects while serving as \href{http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/placement/}{employability tutor}. I'm interested in methods that can \protect\hyperlink{research}{deliver outstanding learning and student experience} using innovative techniques like \protect\hyperlink{vertical-tutoring}{vertical tutoring}, \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/}{industrial mentoring}, \protect\hyperlink{coding-their-future}{working with local schools}, \protect\hyperlink{wikipedia}{Wikipedia editing} and \protect\hyperlink{tuningcomplete}{live music}. 🎸

If you are an \protect\hyperlink{employers}{employer} who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please \protect\hyperlink{contact}{get in touch}. During term time, we edit and highlight some of the best opportunities for students in a weekly newsletter known as the \href{https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about}{Wednesday Waggle}. 🐝

Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary \& secondary school children (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\%E2\%80\%9312}{K--12}), undergraduates \& postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education}{Postgraduate Certificate in Education} (PGCE) at the \href{https://www.bath.ac.uk/}{University of Bath} and worked as a high school teacher in co-educational \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-funded_schools_(England)}{non-selective state-funded schools} in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport before returning to higher education. As well as teaching in the UK I have been fortunate enough to teach in India, Japan and America too. 🇬🇧🇮🇳🇯🇵🇺🇸

Many other hackathons exist, they are usually aimed at beginners looking to learn new skills, rather than experts looking to compete. \citep{Briscoe, hafb}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{employers}{%
\chapter{Employers}\label{employers}}

We work with a wide range of employers from the smallest bedroom startup to the worlds largest multi-national corporations, and are always looking for more organisations that can offer our students a stimulating working environment. According to \href{https://www.highfliers.co.uk}{highfliers.co.uk}, the University of Manchester is the most targeted University in the UK by the \href{https://www.top100graduateemployers.com}{Times Top 100 Graduate Employers}. \citep{times100, highfliers2020, Birchall2019} We can still do better, for example by engaging with a more diverse group of employers, especially those in Manchester and the \href{https://northernpowerhouse.gov.uk/}{Northern Powerhouse}, see \href{https://git.io/manc}{git.io/manc}. \citep{gitmanc, londonvstherest, hebdenbridge, manhattanchester, manchattan}

\hypertarget{careersfairs}{%
\section{Careers fairs}\label{careersfairs}}

Our annual Computer Science careers fair is held in the Kilburn building in autumn, we typically have around 30 employers exhibiting over two days. As space is limited, we are always over-subscribed and are not able to accommodate every employer that our students will be interested in. We give priority to employers that offer internships, placements and graduate roles and have contributed to our community through the activities described on this page. The central careers service also organises:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the big careers fair in \href{https://www.manchestercentral.co.uk/}{Manchester Central} every autumn, see the \href{http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/events/bigcareersfair/}{Big Careers Fair}
\item
  a smaller careers fair in Fallowfield \href{http://www.sport.manchester.ac.uk/facilities/armitage/}{Armitage centre} in May
\item
  hundreds of other employer events on campus during term time \citep{highfliers2020}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{dropins}{%
\section{Drop-in sessions}\label{dropins}}

If you aren't willing or able to exhibit at careers fairs, we also run ad-hoc drop-in sessions where employers can come in and set up a stand in the foyer to talk to computer science students informally on their way to and from lectures. These usually happen during lunch in \href{https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/}{term time}. If you're interested in exhibiting at either of these events, please \protect\hyperlink{Contact}{contact the careers and placements officer Mabel Yau}.

\hypertarget{industryclub}{%
\section{Industry Club}\label{industryclub}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/industry-club-black} \end{center}

All employers are welcome to join our industry club mailing list by sending an email to \href{mailto:listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk}{\nolinkurl{listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk}} with the the text \textbf{subscribe cs-industryclub yourfirstname yoursecondname} in the body of the email message. The industry club is part of our \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/}{wider business engagement activities}.

The mailing list is low-traffic, typically two to three updates per year and an invitation to our annual industry club meeting. We promise not to spam you or sell your email details on to third parties.

\hypertarget{mentoring}{%
\section{Industrial mentoring}\label{mentoring}}

The \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/}{Industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers} allows employers meet students during code review sessions.

\hypertarget{cosupervise}{%
\section{Co-supervised projects}\label{cosupervise}}

If you would like to co-supervise a project student in collaboration with an academic member of staff, there are several options. The best option depends on the domain, level and duration of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Bachelors projects}: these are completed in the final year of a Bachelors degree and last for six months, starting in September and finishing in March. Projects are proposed (and offered to students) in March and start in September of the same year.
\item
  \textbf{Masters projects}: again these are six months in duration but start in March and finish in September. Projects are proposed (and offered to students) in the preceding November.
\item
  \textbf{PhD projects}: For industrially sponsored or co-supervised projects, speak to the research office at \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/}{cs.manchester.ac.uk/research}.
\item
  \textbf{Knowledge Transfer Partnerships}: We have a range of \href{https://www.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-transfer-partnerships-what-they-are-and-how-to-apply}{KTPs}, speak to the research office for details
\item
  \textbf{Impact Acceleration Accounts}: We have a range of \href{https://epsrc.ukri.org/innovation/fundingforimpact/impact-acceleration-accounts/}{IAAs}, speak to the research office for details
\end{itemize}

For Bachelors and Masters projects, you can contact academic members of staff directly, or speak to \href{https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/tim.morris.html}{Tim Morris} (final year project lead) or \href{https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/caroline.jay.html}{Caroline Jay}, who leads our postgraduate taught (Masters) courses.

\hypertarget{the-wednesday-waggle}{%
\section{The Wednesday Waggle}\label{the-wednesday-waggle}}

During term time, we highlight events and vacancies for Computer Science students from a \href{http://dullhunk.github.io/where-can-I-look-for-jobs.html}{wide range of sources} in a weekly newsletter called the \href{https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about}{Wednesday Waggle} 🐝. This goes out to around \textasciitilde1000 Bachelors and Masters students in Manchester each week. If you have vacancies or events you would like our students to know about, \protect\hyperlink{contact}{get in touch with us} or \href{http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/contact/}{contact the careers service}.

\hypertarget{join-the-community}{%
\section{Join the community}\label{join-the-community}}

There is a thriving community of engineers and \href{https://www.manchesterentrepreneurs.co.uk/}{entrepreneurs} in Manchester and across the North of England. One of the best ways to recruit engineers and scientists is to join and \emph{contribute} to the community. Get involved in events, \href{https://www.unicsmcr.com/}{sponsor a hackathon}, deliver a guest lecture, host your own event or \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/}{become a software engineering mentor}. Employers who engage \textbf{early and often} are much more likely to get something back. As an employer, you may also be interested in events run by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \href{https://ise.org.uk}{Institute of Student Employers} (ISE)
\item
  The \href{https://www.agcas.org.uk}{Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services} (AGCAS)
\item
  The \href{https://www.asetonline.org}{Work Based and Placement Learning Association} (ASET)
\end{itemize}

If you're a startup new to employment, you may find the guide at \href{https://www.gov.uk/employ-someone}{gov.uk/employ-someone} useful.

\hypertarget{buzzing}{%
\section{Buzzing!}\label{buzzing}}

At peak times, we can get \textbf{very busy} with many concurrent employer events on campus. \citep{highfliers2020} Please be patient and persistent if we do not reply immediately. Unfortunately, we are not always able to respond to everyone because our students, staff and space are all finite resources. We give priority to employers that have already given their time and expertise to our community.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{employability}{%
\section{Employability}\label{employability}}

We are working hard to improve the employability of students because while having a Computer Science is necessary for some jobs, it is not sufficient. \citep{unemployed, shadboltreview, fincherreview, finchergecco} Over the last decade we have been successful in \emph{more than doubling} the number of our students going on year long placements in industry. This is a win-win-win situtation for:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Students}: benefit from a broader education, and develop social and non-cognitive skills that can be challenging to teach and learn in a purely academic environment. This is known as the \href{https://www.suttontrust.com/research-paper/a-winning-personality-confidence-aspirations-social-mobility/}{winning personality} \citep{winningpersonality}.
\item
  \textbf{Employers}: placements are a cost-effective way for employers to recruit (and retain) graduate talent
\item
  \textbf{Universities}: produce better graduates \citep{Mandilaras2004} with broader and deeper skills, who earn more and get better jobs \citep{winningpersonality}. Well paid placements can also facilitate social mobility. \citep{Wang2018}

Computer Science has only been taught to undergraduates in the UK for 50 short years \citep{babygrowsup, sigcse50}, so there's lots of open questions about how to teach the practical, theoretical and professional aspects of the subject. To that end:

Since we started the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/}{Industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers} in 2015, more than 1000 students have been through the mentoring scheme with 250 students taking the course every year. We are very grateful for continued support from our industrial partners in making this happen.

Mentors meet with a group of six second year students for two one hour meetings and do some gentle code review of their gitlab repository, as they start to fix bugs and add features to a large open source software project. You don't \emph{need} to be an expert in the tools students are using (Java, Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, JUnit and Ant) it is more about the general process (and politics) of building and testing high quality software in large and distributed teams, than the specifics of the codebase (\url{https://stendhalgame.org/}) we happen to be using. Mentors are typically software engineers, both junior and senior.

\hypertarget{vertical-tutoring}{%
\chapter{Vertical tutoring}\label{vertical-tutoring}}

We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) system for undergraduate students. VT is already widespread in secondary education, \citep{vtbernard, druryvert} but as far as we know has not been widely used in higher education.

Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) \href{http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk}{pass.manchester.ac.uk}, \citep{passeffect} vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative from \emph{one of each} year of undergraduate study combined with alumni.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/vertical-tutor-groups} 

}

\caption{Conventional horizontal tutor groups (shown in black) bring together a group of students in the same year. For example, year 1 students meet as a small group once per week during term time with their tutor. Vertical tutor groups (shown in red) are made of of one student from each year and an alumni. Vertical tutor groups extend the idea of PASS, to full stack mentoring, crossing all levels}\label{fig:vertical-fig}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{fullstack}{%
\section{Full stack mentoring}\label{fullstack}}

A vertical tutor group will typically contain five members as shown in Figure \ref{fig:vertical-fig}. The group meets physically where possible, or virtually via a slack channel which consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One first year student
\item
  One second year student
\item
  One penultimate year student (out on industrial placement)
\item
  One final year student (returned from placement or summer internship)
\item
  One member of our alumni, recent graduate or via \href{https://www.network.manchester.ac.uk/}{network.manchester.ac.uk}
\end{enumerate}

Vertical tutor groups meet twice per semester. It is very unlikely that a free timetable slot for all years and alumni can be found during normal office hours, because of the complexities of timetabling. So evenings will be likely to work best. Where possible, tutor groups will meet face to face, with remote members (e.g.~placement students and alumni) typically joining virtually by slack or similar.

\hypertarget{goodfor}{%
\section{What is it good for?}\label{goodfor}}

Vertical tutoring is an attractive idea but does it actually work? If so, how? What is it useful for? We would like to find out:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If there is any appetite for vertical tutoring amongst students and alumni
\item
  How it could work e.g.~with \href{https://slack.com}{slack.com} or \href{https://discordapp.com/}{discord} etc?
\item
  How many times can/should vertical tutor groups meet? Twice per semester? More frequently? Less frequently?
\item
  What are suitable topics for discussion in a vertical tutorial? Careers, wellbeing, networking etc
\item
  What kind of specialist groups could be useful e.g.~all female groups, research focussed tutorial groups (with MSc \& PhD students), ordinary ``vanilla'' groups etc
\item
  How much can we breakdown entrenched year groups that persist throughout education \citep{kills1}
\item
  What might the benefits be? \citep{kills2}
\end{enumerate}

As this is an experiment, students have been selected on a voluntary basis. If you are a student or former student and would like to get involved, let me know.

\hypertarget{howlong}{%
\section{How long will all this take?}\label{howlong}}

We ask that vertical tutees commit to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  two one hour sessions per semester
\item
  allowing time for setup and administration, slack channels, scheduling suitable times and dates with your group
\item
  Two hours of time for feedback and review after each semester, by email survey

In return, the school provides our undergraduate students with a safe and supportive environment in which to teach which extends and augments your current curriculum. This can either be an after school, extension / lunchtime club or during scheduled lesson time, typically between year 7 and 13. This is similar to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_Ambassadors_Scheme}{Undergraduate Ambassador Scheme} (UAS), \citep{uas, Cooper2005} and school placements \citep{Moller2019} except students work is assessed using our final year project framework. \citep{COMP30030, COMP30040} Since these projects were started in 2012, our students have worked with a range of schools in the private and public sector, both selective and non-selective, co-educational and single-sex including:

  Opportunities to engage with a classroom or after school club of children as a Teaching Assistant (TA). This is typically for around one or two hours during term time. Initially, this could be through classroom observation and teacher assistance, culminating in the student delivering at least one lesson (and potentially a series of lessons) with your support and guidance
\item
  Advice, suggestions, feedback, assessment and encouragement from you to suggest the kinds of resources that would be useful, appropriate or engaging for the Computer Science curriculum you are teaching
\item
  Classroom and behaviour management: the students are not trained teachers and will be relying on your expertise in classroom and behaviour management.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{resources-developed-by-students}{%
\subsection{Resources developed by students}\label{resources-developed-by-students}}

Undergraduates typically develop a range of resources. The project will involve development of a computer-based system together with supporting activities, lessons and resources. The resource could be a variety of things including, a game, robotics, animations, hardware (Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc) or software, intended to enthuse school students at one of the Key stages 3 or 4 about fundamental concepts in computing preferably linked to one of the new Computer Science curricula.

\hypertarget{project-timing}{%
\subsection{Project timing}\label{project-timing}}

The projects run for 6 months from September to March, divided into three phases.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{September to October} Observation in the classroom teaching by the student around once per week. Development of ideas for an educational tool that the student will make, with the advice of the classroom teacher
\item
  \textbf{November to January} From November to January, our students develop and tests prototype tool (or tools) with the supporting material, this can happen sooner for students who make a quick start to the project.
\item
  \textbf{February to April} From February to April, our students are expected to liaise closely with teachers to develop an educational tool that will be of use in the classroom using teachers' suggestions as to what is appropriate to build. Students will spend some time in a classroom working closely with teachers and students developing and delivering a new resource for teaching. More details on final year projects can be found in COMP300, the undergraduates already know what is required from their project
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{assessment-and-monitoring}{%
\subsection{Assessment and monitoring}\label{assessment-and-monitoring}}

Formal supervision and mentoring is undertaken by the university (Duncan and David), but we will ask you to fill in a one page form on your assessment of their progress during their time at your school, we very much value your input and hope that these projects can beneficial for both your school and the University. We don't want to burden you with unnecessary bureaucracy that all teachers battle with!

\end{figure}

So why would you, an undergraduate student, want to work on an education project in secondary school? The UK government would like Computer Science should be taught in all secondary schools in the UK. \citep{afterthereboot} However, in many UK schools there is a shortage of teachers who are trained in Computer Science, consequently, many teachers find themselves being asked to teach a subject they may know little about. \citep{shutdownrestart}

Undergraduate students can make a significant difference here, by supporting teachers in the classroom to create and deliver new classroom resources in Computer Science. \citep{computinged} In addition, undergraduate students will have the chance to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  develop leadership skills in the classroom
\item
  gain valuable experience of working on ``real world'' problems in a stimulating environment
\item
  improve your communication skills, especially spoken communication
  work as part of a team (in the school) and join a small group of like-minded undergraduate students (in the University) working on related projects
\item
  test your knowledge \& technical ability in a challenging and dynamic environment working with young people
\item
  last, but not least, there is a good chance you will have lots of fun and have a rewarding experience of teaching
  make yourself more employable by doing all of the above
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{who-is-involved}{%
\subsection{Who is involved?}\label{who-is-involved}}

Initially, the number of undergraduate students involved in these projects will be less than ten. We also require that you will have a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st in your second year exams. Projects are co-supervised by Duncan with additional supervision from an experienced member of teaching staff at a participating school.

We have carefully selected schools in Manchester that are relatively easy for you to get to, are already teaching Computer Science and have supportive staff and teachers in place to help you. You will be expected to work directly with school children with the support of the teaching staff in your school. Schools we have worked with are all the Manchester area.

\hypertarget{what-will-the-educational-projects-be-expected-to-deliver}{%
\subsection{What will the educational projects be expected to deliver?}\label{what-will-the-educational-projects-be-expected-to-deliver}}

You will be expected to work closely with the teacher to develop resources that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  engage students with one or more aspects of the new Computer Science curriculum at an appropriate key stage. This is usually \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_3}{key stage 3}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_4}{key stage 4} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_5}{key stage 5} ages 11-18.
\item
  complement \textbf{and extend} the schools current provision for computer science in the school
\end{itemize}

During the project you will be spending a significant amount of time in the classroom, visiting your school every week during school term time throughout the duration of your project to develop resources. These must include a computer-based teaching tool which may use, for example, Raspberry Pi's, visual aids, demonstrations, videos, online questionnaires, formative feedback, games, drones, robotics, music, \citep{Aaron2016} algorithms \citep{Kubica2012} or even just the command line \citep{conquerthecommandline} etc.\footnote{Conquer the command line is part of the The MagPi essentials series, there are lots of others like it you may find useful on using the camera module, gaming in python, simple electronics and more at \url{https://store.rpipress.cc}} In addition, guidance on classroom use, such as a lesson or series of lessons to support the tool. Remember that you don't actually need a computer, see \href{https://csunplugged.org}{Computer Science Unplugged}: Computer Science without a Computer. \citep{Bell2018}

All deliverables for standard final year projects will be expected of these projects including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  first semester presentation
\item
  demonstration of the resource being used in the classroom
\item
  final written report
\end{itemize}

Assessments for these projects will be as for standard projects, \citep{COMP30030, COMP30040} but part of the evaluation of the project will be a classroom demonstration, a description and evaluation of which should be included in your final report.

\hypertarget{getting-a-head-start}{%
\subsection{Getting a head start}\label{getting-a-head-start}}

There are plenty of online courses you can do to improve you effectiveness in the classroom.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Impact of Technology: How To Lead Classroom Discussions. Learn how to keep 14-16 year-old students engaged in discussions while teaching computer science. Supported by Google \href{https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/impact-of-technology}{futurelearn.com/courses/impact-of-technology}
\item
  Teaching Physical Computing with Raspberry Pi and Python \href{https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/physical-computing-raspberry-pi-python}{futurelearn.com/courses/physical-computing-raspberry-pi-python}
\item
  Since some of your teaching is likely to be asynchronous, you would also benefit from having a look at \href{https://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/education/take-your-teaching-online/content-section-overview}{taking your teaching online} from OpenLearn

COVID 19 is revolutionising teaching, from primary and secondary school right through to higher education. You need to get clued up on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning}{blended learning}. Start with \href{http://www.elearning.fse.manchester.ac.uk/fseta/moving-to-blended-learning-part-1-terminology-and-concepts/}{Moving to Blended Learning, Part 1: Terminology and Concepts}, then take a look the video below with Steve Pettifer explaining techniques for slides that work for blended learning videos:

When you teach, think about how you can support students before and after your time in the classroom.

\hypertarget{referee}{%
\chapter{Will you write a reference for me?}\label{referee}}

As employability tutor, I get asked to write \emph{lots} references for students applying for jobs and further study. I'm happy to do this if you've been personal tutee or I've worked with you outside of ordinary teaching. However, it's impossible to for me to say YES to every request for a reference. For students I haven't worked with, it is difficult to do, because all I can confirm is facts (attendance, academic marks, degree program) without opinions which doesn't make for a very compelling reference.

Whoever agrees to be your referee, make sure you read and understand the following:

\hypertarget{who-can-provide-a-reference-for-me}{%
\section{Who can provide a reference for me?}\label{who-can-provide-a-reference-for-me}}

The best person to provide a reference for you is somebody who knows you, such as your personal tutor. See the careers service guide \href{http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/faqs/references}{what are references and how should I choose a referee?} and \href{http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=1921}{guidance to staff providing references for students} from the University of Manchester, which gives extra context.

It is good to have references from different sources, so if you are providing several referees try to pick people from inside and outside the University. Within the University, this is most likely to be your tutor:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your personal tutor from year one
\item
  Your personal tutor from year two (if different to first year)
\item
  Your IE tutor (mostly likely me)
\item
  Your third year project supervisor
\item
  Anyone else who knows you personally
\end{itemize}

If you ask somebody who does not know you very well to write a reference for you, all that they are able to do in a reference is confirm rather dull facts such as your grades, your attendance, start date and graduation date. As I've already said, this does not make for a very useful reference.

\hypertarget{should-i-ask-permission-from-my-referee}{%
\section{Should I ask permission from my referee?}\label{should-i-ask-permission-from-my-referee}}

You should always ask the person providing your reference.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-reference-for}{%
\section{What is a reference for?}\label{what-is-a-reference-for}}

References have two main purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Providing and confirming \emph{facts}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    to give a factual account, e.g.~of academic record, attendance, etc
  \item
    to confirm the accuracy of statements made in an application
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Providing \emph{opinions}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    to give the referee's opinion as to the candidate's suitability for the post/course in
    question, and his/her potential for the future
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{how-can-i-help-my-referee}{%
\section{How can I help my referee?}\label{how-can-i-help-my-referee}}

It can make it much easier for your referee if you provide them with information you would like them to mention in your reference. This might include information about your character, projects you have completed or specific aspects of your academic performance. Providing an up to date CV also helps your referee.

\hypertarget{can-i-have-a-copy-of-my-reference}{%
\section{Can I have a copy of my reference?}\label{can-i-have-a-copy-of-my-reference}}

It is unusual for a referee to provide a reference directly to its subject (that's you).

Typically, a referee is asked to provide a reference for a student (or former student) directly by the organisation concerned. For example, if you're applying for postgraduate study, the reference request will be sent by the University directly to your referees email address, who will usually respond by clicking on a link to upload the reference document.

You can make a request to see your reference under data protection law.
