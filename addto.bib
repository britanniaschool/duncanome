Self-awareness is a supreme gift, a treasure as precious as life. This is what makes us human. But it comes with a costly price: the wound of mortality. Our existence is forever shadowed by the knowledge that we will grow, blossom, and, inevitably, diminish and die

Paid work experience and ‘sandwich degrees’ help boost social mobility – new research

via OU (sort of) CBI
Soft skills, essential skills, employability skills, transferable skills, 21st century
skills, interpersonal skills, life skills and character education, are just some of
the interchangeable but not identical ways of describing what it means to be
‘work ready’.

https://www.cbi.org.uk/media/3841/12546_tess_2019.pdf

via OU
A similar report published by the Department of Economics claimed that by 2020 over half a million UK workers would be ‘significantly held back’ by their lack of soft skills including teamwork (Clarke, 2016).

Two problems have been identified here:

1. There aren’t enough employees who have adequate team skills
1. Job applicants are not good at marketing their soft skills like teamwork in their applications and at interview, even if they do have them.

Skills shortage costing STEM sector £1.5bn
https://www.stem.org.uk/news-and-views/news/skills-shortage-costing-stem-sector-15bn

Deming shows that in recent years, many jobs requiring only mathematical skills have been automated. Bank tellers and statistical clerks have suffered. […]

The study shows that workers who successfully combine mathematical and interpersonal skills in the knowledge-based economies of the future should find many rewarding and lucrative opportunities.
Refocusing skills education

The challenge now, says Deming, is for educators to complement their teaching of technical skills like mathematics and computer science, with a focus on making sure the workers of the future have the soft skills to compete in the new jobs market.
