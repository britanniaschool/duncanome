Hello, my name is Duncan. I'm a lecturer in the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{Department of Computer Science} at the \href{https://www.manchester.ac.uk}{University of Manchester} where I lead the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/}{Industrial Experience (IE)} program. This elective course has over 100 students every year working for 12 months in industry in the penultimate year of their degree. üéì

I \protect\hyperlink{teaching}{teach} undergraduate courses, supervise tutorials, final year projects and masters projects. I serve as \href{http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year2/}{second year tutor}, employability tutor, while also serving on the \href{http://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/study-support/mitigating-circumstances/}{mitigating circumstances} committee and the exam board. I'm interested in methods that can \protect\hyperlink{research}{deliver high quality learning and student experience} by using innovative techniques like \protect\hyperlink{vertical-tutoring-1}{vertical tutoring}, \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/}{industrial mentoring}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding}{live coding}, \protect\hyperlink{wikipedia}{Wikipedia editing} and live / recorded music. üé∏

If you are an \protect\hyperlink{employers}{employer} who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please \protect\hyperlink{contact}{get in touch}. During term time, we highlight opportunities for students in the \href{https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about}{Wednesday Waggle}. üêù

My \href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull}{background} is a mixture of Natural Sciences (\href{http://www.plantsciences.manchester.ac.uk/}{Plant Sciences, BSc}), Computer Science (\href{http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/msc2003.html}{MSc} \& PhD) and software engineering. I've worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring}{BBC Monitoring}, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company}{Ford Motor Company} and the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service}{National Health Service} (NHS). While working on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna}{Apache Taverna} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid}{myGrid} I completed a \href{https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578}{PhD} at the University of Manchester. This was followed by a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher}{postdoc} at the \href{http://www.mib.ac.uk/}{Manchester Institute of Biotechnology} (MIB) on the \href{http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/}{Refine project} and a stint as a software engineer on \href{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/}{Chemical Entities of Biological Interest} (ChEBI) in Cambridge, UK at the European Bioinformatics Institute (\href{https://www.ebi.ac.uk}{ebi.ac.uk}). üá™üá∫

I have taught english, maths, science and engineering at a range of levels from primary through to postgraduate. In 2011, I completed a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education}{PGCE} at the \href{https://www.bath.ac.uk/}{University of Bath} and trained at co-educational \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-funded_schools_(England)}{non-selective state-funded schools} in \href{https://www.lydiardparkacademy.org.uk/}{Swindon}, \href{https://shaftesburyschool.co.uk/}{Shaftesbury} and \href{https://www.st-annes.stockport.sch.uk/}{Stockport} before returning to higher education. Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught primary \& secondary school children (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\%E2\%80\%9312}{K--12}), undergraduates \& postgraduates in the UK, India and America. üá¨üáßüáÆüá≥üá∫üá∏

\chapter{Vertical tutoring}\label{vertical-tutoring-1}}

We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) system for undergraduate students. VT is already widespread in secondary education (see \href{https://www.verticaltutoring.org/}{verticaltutoring.org}), \citep{vtbernard} but as far as we know has not been used in higher education.

Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) \href{http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk}{pass.manchester.ac.uk}, vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative from \emph{one of each} year of undergraduate study combined with alumni.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/vertical-tutor-groups} 

}

\caption{Conventional horizontal tutor groups (shown in black) bring together a group of students in the same year. For example, year 1 students meet as a small group once per week during term time with their tutor. Vertical tutor groups (shown in red) are made of of one student from each year and an alumni. Vertical tutor groups extend the idea of PASS, to full stack mentoring, crossing all levels}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-7}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{full-stack-mentoring}{%
\section{Full stack mentoring}\label{full-stack-mentoring}}

A vertical tutor group will typically contain five members as shown in Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:vertical-fig}. The group meets physically where possible, or virtually via a slack channel which consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One first year student
\item
  One second year student
\item
  One penultimate year student (out on industrial placement)
\item
  One final year student (returned from placement or summer internship)
\item
  One member of our alumni, recent graduate or via \href{https://www.network.manchester.ac.uk/}{network.manchester.ac.uk}
\end{enumerate}

Vertical tutor groups meet twice per semester. It is very unlikely that a free timetable slot for all years and alumni can be found during normal office hours, because of the complexities of timetabling. So evenings will be likely to work best. Where possible, tutor groups will meet face to face, with remote members (e.g.~placement students and alumni) typically joining virtually by slack or similar.

\hypertarget{what-is-it-good-for}{%
\section{What is it good for?}\label{what-is-it-good-for}}

Vertical tutoring is an attractive idea but does it actually work? If so, how? What is it useful for? We would like to find out:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If there is any appetite for vertical tutoring amongst students and alumni
\item
  How it could work e.g.~with \href{https://slack.com}{slack.com} or \href{https://discordapp.com/}{discord} etc?
\item
  How many times can/should vertical tutor groups meet? Twice per semester? More frequently? Less frequently?
\item
  What are suitable topics for discussion in a vertical tutorial? Careers, wellbeing, networking etc
\item
  What kind of specialist groups could be useful e.g.~all female groups, research focussed tutorial groups (with MSc \& PhD students), ordinary ``vanilla'' groups etc
\end{enumerate}

As this is an experiment, students have been selected on a voluntary basis. If you're a student or former student and would like to get involved, let me know.

\section{How long will all this take?}\label{how-long-will-all-this-take}}

We ask that tutees commit to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  two one hour sessions per semester
\item
  some setup and administration, slack channels, scheduling suitable times and dates with your group
\item
  Two hours of time for feedback and review after each semester, by email survey
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{coding-their-future}{%
\chapter{Coding their future}\label{coding-their-future}}

\textbf{Coding their future} is a collaboration \& partnership between your school and the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{Department of Computer Science} at the University of Manchester to improve and support Computer Science education at key stages 3 and 4. \citep{afterthereboot} \citep{cambridgegcse}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/schools-banner} \end{center}

We provide schools with a final year student who can teach Computer Science in your school or college as a teaching assistant. In return, the school provides our undergraduate students with a safe and supportive environment in which to teach which extends and augments your curriculum. This can either be an after school, extension / lunchtime club or during scheduled lesson time, typically between year 7 and 13. Since these projects were started in 2012, our students have worked with a range of schools in the private and public sector, both selective and non-selective, co-educational and single-sex including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{http://www.fairfieldhigh.tameside.sch.uk/}{Fairfield High School for Girls}, Droylsden
\item
  \href{http://www.utcmediacityuk.org.uk/}{University Technical College (UTC) \(@\)MediaCityUK}, Salford
\item
  \href{https://www.manchestercommunicationacademy.com/}{Manchester Communication Academy}, Harpurhey
\item
  \href{https://thebarlowrchigh.co.uk/}{The Barlow RC High School}, Didsbury
\item
  \href{https://www.chhs.org.uk/}{Cheadle Hulme High School}, Stockport
\item
  \href{http://www.aggs.trafford.sch.uk/}{Altrincham Grammar School for Girls}, Trafford
\item
  \href{https://www.agsb.co.uk/}{Altrincham Grammar School for Boys}, Trafford
\item
  \href{https://www.mgs.org/}{Manchester Grammar School}, Fallowfield
\end{itemize}

The projects were setup by \protect\hyperlink{contact}{Duncan Hull} and \href{http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/}{David Rydeheard} (retired 2019), and are now run and supervised by Duncan. We hope to transfer ideas between private and public sector, to find out more, see \protect\hyperlink{guidance-for-teachers}{guidance for teachers} and \protect\hyperlink{guidance-for-students}{guidance for students} below.

\hypertarget{guidance-for-teachers}{%
\section{Guidance for teachers}\label{guidance-for-teachers}}

Our aim is to support the teaching and learning of Computer Science in your school and to help engage schoolchildren in the subject. This page describes what we can provide you with and what we expect to get in return.

\hypertarget{what-the-university-is-offering-your-school}{%
\subsection{What the University is offering your school}\label{what-the-university-is-offering-your-school}}

The University of Manchester will provide your school or college with at least one student ambassador with some relevant training who has completed two years of study in Computer Science and has:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A good knowledge of, and enthusiasm for Computer Science
\item
  Completed DBS clearance
\item
  An interest in teaching and working with young people
\item
  Achieved a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st class degree in their second year
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-the-university-expects-from-your-school}{%
\subsection{What the University expects from your school}\label{what-the-university-expects-from-your-school}}

In return, we expect that the school provides the undergraduate student with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Opportunities to engage with a classroom or after school club of children as a Teaching Assistant (TA). This is typically for around one or two hours during term time. Initially, this could be through classroom observation and teacher assistance, culminating in the student delivering at least one lesson (and potentially a series of lessons) with your support and guidance
\item
  Advice, suggestions, feedback, assessment and encouragement from you to suggest the kinds of resources that would be useful, appropriate or engaging for the Computer Science curriculum you are teaching
\item
  Classroom and behaviour management: the students are not trained teachers and will be relying on your expertise in classroom and behaviour management.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{resources-developed-by-students}{%
\subsection{Resources developed by students}\label{resources-developed-by-students}}

Undergraduates typically develop a range of resources. The project will involve development of a computer-based system together with supporting activities, lessons and resources. The resource could be a variety of things including, a game, robotics, animations, hardware (Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc) or software, intended to enthuse school students at one of the Key stages 3 or 4 about fundamental concepts in computing preferably linked to one of the new Computer Science curricula.

\hypertarget{project-timing}{%
\subsection{Project timing}\label{project-timing}}

The projects run for 6 months from September to March, divided into three phases.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{September to October} Observation in the classroom teaching by the student around once per week. Development of ideas for an educational tool that the student will make, with the advice of the classroom teacher
\item
  \textbf{November to January} From November to January, our students develop and tests prototype tool (or tools) with the supporting material, this can happen sooner for students who make a quick start to the project.
\item
  \textbf{February to April} From February to April, our students are expected to liaise closely with teachers to develop an educational tool that will be of use in the classroom using teachers' suggestions as to what is appropriate to build. Students will spend some time in a classroom working closely with teachers and students developing and delivering a new resource for teaching. More details on final year projects can be found in COMP300, the undergraduates already know what is required from their project
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{assessment-and-monitoring}{%
\subsection{Assessment and monitoring}\label{assessment-and-monitoring}}

Formal supervision and mentoring is undertaken by the university (Duncan and David), but we will ask you to fill in a one page form on your assessment of their progress during their time at your school, we very much value your input and hope that these projects can beneficial for both your school and the University. We don't want to burden you with unnecessary bureaucracy that all teachers battle with!

\hypertarget{guidance-for-students}{%
\section{Guidance for students}\label{guidance-for-students}}

So why would you, an undergraduate student, want to work on an education project in secondary school? The UK government would like Computer Science should be taught in all secondary schools in the UK.\citep{afterthereboot} However, in many UK schools there is a shortage of teachers who are trained in Computer Science, consequently, many teachers find themselves being asked to teach a subject they may know little about.\citep{shutdownrestart}

Undergraduate students can make a significant difference here, by supporting teachers in the classroom to create and deliver new classroom resources in Computer Science.\citep{computinged} In addition, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  develop leadership skills in the classroom
\item
  gain valuable experience of working on ``real world'' problems in a stimulating environment
\item
  improve your communication skills, especially spoken communication
  work as part of a team (in the school) and join a small group of like-minded undergraduate students (in the University) working on related projects
\item
  test your knowledge \& technical ability in a challenging and dynamic environment working with young people
\item
  last, but not least, there is a good chance you will have lots of fun and have a rewarding experience of teaching
  make yourself more employable by doing all of the above
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{who-is-involved}{%
\subsection{Who is involved?}\label{who-is-involved}}

Initially, the number of undergraduate students involved in these projects will be less than ten. We also require that you will have a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st in your second year exams. Projects are supervised by Dr.~Duncan Hull with additional supervision from an experienced member of teaching staff at a participating school.

We have carefully selected schools in Manchester that are relatively easy for you to get to, are already teaching Computer Science and have supportive staff and teachers in place to help you. You will be expected to work directly with school children with the support of the teaching staff in your school. Schools we have worked with are all the Manchester area.

\hypertarget{what-will-the-educational-projects-be-expected-to-deliver}{%
\subsection{What will the educational projects be expected to deliver?}\label{what-will-the-educational-projects-be-expected-to-deliver}}

You will be expected to work closely with the teacher to develop resources that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  engage students with one or more aspects of the new Computer Science curriculum at an appropriate key stage. This is usually key stage 3 and/or 4, ages 11-16.
\item
  complement the schools current provision for computer science in the school
\end{itemize}

In order to achieve this, you will need to attend a series of education and outreach events, as part of the programme and sign up and complete the Science, Technology, Engineering \& Mathematics (STEMnet) ambassador training (which includes DBS checks) supplied by the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) in Manchester.

During the project you will be spending a significant amount of time in the classroom, visiting your school at least once every two weeks throughout the duration of your project to develop resources. These must include a computer-based teaching tool which may use, for example, Raspberry Pi's, visual aids, demonstrations, videos, online questionnaires, formative feedback, games, drones, robotics etc. In addition, guidance on classroom use, such as a lesson or series of lessons to support the tool.

All deliverables for standard final year projects will be expected of these projects including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  first semester presentation
\item
  demonstration of the resource being used in the classroom
\item
  final written report
\end{itemize}

Assessments for these projects will be as for standard projects, but part of the evaluation of the project will be a classroom demonstration, a description and evaluation of which should be included in your final report.

\hypertarget{when-do-the-projects-start-and-finish}{%
