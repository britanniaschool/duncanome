## All years: debug your CV

Open office hours:

* You can drop-in to my weekly one-to-one CV clinics for Computer Science students in LF25 during term-time during my open office hours: Mondays from 10am to midday in LF25 / Tootill 1.
* If you haven't written a CV (two pages), rÃ©sumÃ© (one page) or LinkedIn profile before, you might find the _Debug your CV_ guide useful at [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv). [@debugyourcv]
* Get feedback on your CV from as many people as possible, because "[given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law)" [@Raymond1999]
* Outside of term time, it's best to book an appointment

## Extracurricular

```

* Organising, facilitating and promoting extra-curricular activities such as [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) [@Briscoe; @Warner2017] and [edit-a-thons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon). [@goodbadugly; @troubled; @findingada2019] These usually occur off-timetable, for example Wednesday afternoons, evenings and weekends.
* Served as a judge for [studenthack.com](https://www.studenthack.com) and [greatunihack.com](https://greatunihack.com) since 2014. These two hackathons are organised by [UniCS](https://www.unicsmcr.com/), a student-led tech society formed by the merger of HackSoc (computer geekery) and CSSoc (socialising). Many other hackathons exist, they are usually aimed at beginners looking to learn new skills, rather than experts looking to compete. [@Briscoe; @hafb]
