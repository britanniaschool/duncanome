# Employers
We work with a wide range of employers from the smallest bedroom startup to the worlds largest multi-national corporations, and are always looking for more organisations that can offer our students a stimulating working environment. According to [highfliers.co.uk](https://www.highfliers.co.uk), the University of Manchester is the most targeted University in the UK by the [Times Top 100 Graduate Employers](https://www.top100graduateemployers.com). [@times100; @highfliers2019; @Birchall2019] We can still do better, for example by engaging with a more diverse group of employers, especially those in Manchester and the [Northern Powerhouse](https://northernpowerhouse.gov.uk/), see [git.io/manc](https://git.io/manc).

## Recruiting students

If you are recruiting computer scientists and software engineers as a summer interns, placement students or as graduates please get in touch with me or [Mabel Yau](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mabel-yau) (careers and placements officer). We typically have around 250 undergraduate students graduating annually, alongside a smaller number of Masters and PhD students. The [entry tariff](https://www.ucas.com/ucas/tariff-calculator) of our students (A* AA including A* in mathematics) is comparable to other leading Computer Science (CS) departments in [Russell Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group) universities as shown in the table below.


Institute | Entry tariff  | CS Students per year
----------- | ----------- | --------
[University of Cambridge](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/computer-science) | A* A* A | ~100
[University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/computer-science-bsc/2020)| A* A* A | ~150
[University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2019/00560/bsc-computer-science/) | A* A A | ~250
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/ug/beng-meng-computing/) | A* A A| ~200
[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/computer-science) | A* A A | ~50

If you are looking to recruit science and engineering students from other disciplines like [Physics](https://www.physics.manchester.ac.uk/), [Maths](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/), [Chemistry](https://www.chemistry.manchester.ac.uk/), Mechnical, Aerospace & Civil Engineering ([MACE](https://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/)), [Materials Science](https://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/) and Electrical & Electronic Engineering ([EEE](https://www.eee.manchester.ac.uk/)) you should talk to staff in those departments or the central careers service at [careers.manchester.ac.uk](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/)

## Careers fairs
Our annual Computer Science careers fair is held in the Kilburn building in autumn, we typically have around 30 employers exhibiting over two days. As space is limited, we are always over-subscribed and are not able to accommodate every employer that our students will be interested in. The central careers service also organises:  

* the big careers fair in [Manchester Central](https://www.manchestercentral.co.uk/) every autumn, see the [Big Careers Fair](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/events/bigcareersfair/)
* a smaller careers fair in Fallowfield [Armitage centre](http://www.sport.manchester.ac.uk/facilities/armitage/) in May
* hundreds of other employer events on campus during term time [@highfliers2019]

## Drop-in sessions
If you aren't able to exhibit at careers fairs, we also run ad-hoc drop-in sessions where employers can come in and set up a stand in the foyer to talk to computer science students informally on their way to and from lectures. These usually happen during lunch in [term time](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/). If you're interested in exhibiting at either of these events, please [contact the careers and placements officer Mabel Yau][Contact].

## Industry Club

```

All employers are welcome to join our industry club mailing list by sending an email to listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk with the the text **subscribe cs-industryclub yourfirstname yoursecondname** in the body of the email message. The industry club is part of our [wider business engagement activities](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/).

The mailing list is low-traffic, typically two to three updates per year and an invitation to our annual industry club meeting. We promise not to spam you or sell your email details on to third parties.

## Industrial mentoring
The [Industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/) allows employers meet students during code review sessions.


## The Wednesday Waggle üêù

During term time, we highlight events and vacancies for Computer Science students from a [wide range of sources](http://dullhunk.github.io/where-can-I-look-for-jobs.html) in a weekly newsletter called the [Wednesday Waggle](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about). This goes out to around ~1000 Bachelors and Masters students in Manchester each week. If you have vacancies or events you would like our students to know about, [get in touch with us][Contact] or [contact the careers service](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/contact/).

## Buzzing!

At peak times, we can get **very busy** with many concurrent employer events on campus. [@highfliers2019] Please be patient and persistent if we do not reply immediately. Unfortunately, we are not always able to respond to everyone because our students, staff and space are all finite resources. We give priority to employers that have already given their time and expertise to our community.
