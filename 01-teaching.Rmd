## All years: debug your CV

* You can drop-in to my weekly one-to-one CV clinics for Computer Science students in LF25 during term-time.
* If you haven't written a CV (two pages), rÃ©sumÃ© (one page) or LinkedIn profile before, you might find the _Debug your CV_ guide useful at [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv).
* Get feedback on your CV from as many people as possible, because "[given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law)"
* Outside of term time, it's best to book an appointment

I'm proud to have served as a judge of the fantastic [studenthack.com](https://www.studenthack.com) and [greatunihack.com](https://greatunihack.com) since 2014. These [hackathons](https://medium.com/tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000) are organised by [UniCS](https://www.unicsmcr.com/), a student-led tech society formerly known as HackSoc and CSSoc.
