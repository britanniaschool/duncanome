## Guiding your future {#guide}

Coding your future is a guidebook and course is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While the guide supports undergraduate teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn’t actually matter:

* what stage of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
* what level you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
* what subject you are studying, as long as you are computationally curious
* what institution you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
* where in the world you are studying

There is something in this guidebook for any student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👩🏿‍💻
