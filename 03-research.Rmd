# Research and publications

My research interests are in Computer Science Education (CSE) and Wikipedia. ðŸ”¬

## SIGCSE
In the UK we have only been teaching Computer Science to undergradudates [for 50 short years](http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/11/07/baby_computer_40_interview_feature.shtml), so there's lots of open questions about how to teach the practical aspects of the subject.

* I'm a member of [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) in Computer Science Education ([SIGCSE.org](https://sigcse.org)).
* As part of that I founded and chair a [journal club](https://duncan.hull.name/2019/07/17/sigcse-journal-club/) for educators in Manchester, if you'd like to join us, subscribe to the mailing list at SIGCSE-JOURNAL-CLUB@LISTSERV.MANCHESTER.AC.UK
* I'm serving on the program committee for [Computing Education & Practice (CEP)](http://community.dur.ac.uk/cep.conference) at Durham University.

## Code Club
I lead an after school [CodeClub](https://codeclub.org), part of a global network of free coding clubs for 9-13 year olds.

## Wikipedia
Wikipedia (and its sister project [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org)) are great tools for improving your digital skills and communication skills, regardless of your level of computer literacy. As long serving editor of Wikipedia since 2004, I organise and participate in [edit-a-thons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon) to train and recruit new Wikipedia editors in collaboration with other volunteers.
