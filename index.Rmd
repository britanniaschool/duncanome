# About {-}

I am a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) where I lead the [Industrial Experience (IE)](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/) program. Every year, around 100 of our undergraduate students spend a year in industry as an intercalated part of their degree.


I [teach][Students] undergraduate courses, supervise tutorials, final year and masters projects. I serve as [second year tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year2/) and employability tutor. I'm interested in [better teaching methods][Research] for example, using new ideas like [vertical tutoring][Vertical tutorials].

If you are an [employer][Employers] who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please [get in touch][Contact]. During term time, we highlight opportunities for students via the [Wednesday Waggle](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about).

## Background {-}

My background is a mixture of Natural Science ([Plant Sciences, BSc](http://www.plantsciences.manchester.ac.uk/)) and Computer Science (MSc & PhD). Iâ€™ve worked as a consultant and developer of web applications for various organisations including [BBC Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring), The [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS). While working on the [Apache Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna), [myGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid) and [Refine project](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/) I completed a [PhD](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578) and [postdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) in [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) at the University of Manchester. More recently, I was also employed as a software engineer ([Chemical Entities of Biological Interest: ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/)) of a biochemical database by the European Bioinformatics Institute ([ebi.ac.uk](https://www.ebi.ac.uk)) on the [Wellcome Trust Genome Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Genome_Campus) in Cambridge, UK.

I have taught various flavours of Science to primary & secondary school children, sixth formers, undergraduates & postgraduates in England and India.  More details at [linkedin.com/in/duncanhull](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull).

## Tools {-}
This website is written in [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and built using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) and [knitr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitr) in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), with the [source available on github](https://github.com/dullhunk/hulled). I could have (should have?) used [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), but opted for bookdown because it is much ~~less bloated~~ easier to use. ðŸ”¨
