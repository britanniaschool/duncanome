Self-awareness is a supreme gift, a treasure as precious as life. This is what makes us human. But it comes with a costly price: the wound of mortality. Our existence is forever shadowed by the knowledge that we will grow, blossom, and, inevitably, diminish and die

Soft skills, essential skills, employability skills, transferable skills, 21st century
skills, interpersonal skills, life skills and character education, are just some of

A similar report published by the Department of Economics claimed that by 2020 over half a million UK workers would be ‘significantly held back’ by their lack of soft skills including teamwork (Clarke, 2016).

1. There aren’t enough employees who have adequate team skills
1. Job applicants are not good at marketing their soft skills like teamwork in their applications and at interview, even if they do have them.

Refocusing skills education

The challenge now, says Deming, is for educators to complement their teaching of technical skills like mathematics and computer science, with a focus on making sure the workers of the future have the soft skills to compete in the new jobs market.
