(ref:captioncycloturing) Paying homage to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) at a mural on the [Princess Parkway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5103_road) by [tankpetrol.com](http://tankpetrol.com/). According to [Jonathan Swinton](https://www.manturing.net/jonathan), Turing is the “patron saint of Manchester” [@manturing]. As a [Manchester icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_of_Manchester), he is commemorated locally by the [Alan Turing building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Building), the [Alan Turing Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Memorial), [some blue plaques](https://duncan.hull.name/2021/07/07/turings-house/) and the [Alan Turing Way](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alan+Turing+Way,+Manchester/) [@turingway]
