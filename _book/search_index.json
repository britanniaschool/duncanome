[["index.html", "Dr. Duncan Hull, University of Manchester Hello! Full stack teaching What’s the story? Toolbox Get a life!", " Dr. Duncan Hull, University of Manchester Hello! Hello and welcome to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. My name is Duncan and I’m a lecturer (≈ Assistant Professor) here with responsibility for managing our Industrial Experience (IE) program. I teach undergraduate &amp; postgraduate students, supervise tutorials &amp; projects while serving as employability tutor. I’m interested in methods that can improve teaching, learning and the student experience by: Developing Coding Your Future: a guidebook (and course) for students at cdyf.me Training better software engineers in collaboration with our industrial mentors Updating students on opportunities with the weekly Wednesday waggle newsletter at waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk Engaging with a wide range of employers through our industry club Supporting local schools teaching computing by coding their future Improving students communication skills with Wikipedia editing &amp; training Growing and building the teaching computing community by journal clubbing at sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk Our elective industrial experience program has up to 100 students every year working in paid employment for the penultimate (“sandwich”) year-in-industry of their undergraduate degrees. If you are an employer who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please get in touch. 🐝 Full stack teaching Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary &amp; secondary school children (K–12), undergraduates &amp; postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at the University of Bath and worked as a high school science teacher in co-educational non-selective state-funded schools in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport before returning to higher education. As well as teaching in the UK I have been fortunate enough to teach in India, Japan and America too. 🇬🇧🇮🇳🇯🇵🇺🇸 What’s the story? Born in Bath, Somerset and raised using a secret West Country recipe, my story is a mixture of Natural Sciences (Plant Sciences, BSc), Computer Science (MSc &amp; PhD) and software engineering. I’ve worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including BBC Monitoring, the Ford Motor Company and the National Health Service (NHS). I was part of the Apache Taverna and myGrid projects before completing a postdoc at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB) on the Refine project. This was followed by a short stint as a software engineer of Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in Cambridge, UK. 🇪🇺 Toolbox This website1 is built using bookdown with R markdown, the R language, gitbook, JavaScript, knitr, LaTeX, Pandoc, RStudio and TLC.

(Wickham and Grolemund 2017) This typically involves various combinations of Wikipedia, Wikdata, SPARQL (DuCharme 2013) and chatbots. 🤖 (Sharwood 2019) 1.7 PhD students If you’ve got any interesting PhD research ideas you like to pitch to me, particularly if they involve computer science education or professional issues, I’m all ears! 👂 1.8 Extracurricular Outside all of the above, I also get involved in: Organising, facilitating and promoting extra-curricular activities such as hackathons (Briscoe and Mulligan 2014; Warner and Guo 2017) and edit-a-thons. (Hull 2017, 2015; Mohammad-Qureshi and Hull 2019) These usually occur off-timetable, for example Wednesday afternoons, evenings and weekends. Judging competitions such as studenthack.com and greatunihack.com since 2014. These two hackathons are organised by UniCS, a student-led tech society formed by the merger of HackSoc (computer geekery) and CSSoc (socialising). Many other hackathons exist, they are usually aimed at beginners looking to learn new skills, rather than experts looking to compete.

According to highfliers.co.uk, the University of Manchester is the most targeted University in the UK by the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers. (Birchall 2020a, 2020b, 2019) We can still do better, for example by engaging with a more diverse group of employers, especially those in Manchester and the Northern Powerhouse, see git.io/manc. (Hull 2020b; Davis 2014a, 2014b; Ovenden 2019; Wainwright 2019) Figure 2.1: Any employer recruiting our students is welcome to join our industry club, see details below 2.1 Recruiting students If you are recruiting computer scientists and software engineers as a summer interns, placement students or as graduates please get in touch with me or Mabel Yau (careers and placements officer). We typically have around 250 undergraduate students graduating annually, alongside a smaller number of Masters and PhD students. The entry tariff of our students (A* AA including A* in mathematics) is comparable to other leading Computer Science (CS) departments in Russell Group universities as shown in the table below. Institute UCAS entry tariff CS Students per year University of Cambridge A* A* A ~100 University College London A* A* A ~150 Imperial College London A* A* A ~200 University of Manchester A* A A ~250 University of Oxford A* A A ~50 A demographic breakdown of our students in Computer Science is show in Figure 2.2. If you are looking to recruit science and engineering students from other disciplines like Physics, Maths, Chemistry, Mechnical, Aerospace &amp; Civil Engineering (MACE), Materials Science and Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering (EEE) you should talk to: staff in those departments and/or the central careers service at careers.manchester.ac.uk Figure 2.2: Where our undergraduate students come from: As of October 2019 we have 877 undergraduate Computer Science students divided between UK/EU (shown in green), EU not UK (shown in orange) and non-EU overseas (shown in yellow) 2.2 Careers fairs Our annual Computer Science careers fair is held in the Kilburn building in autumn, we typically have around 30 employers exhibiting over two days. As space is limited, we are always over-subscribed and are not able to accommodate every employer that our students will be interested in. We give priority to employers that offer internships, placements and graduate roles and have contributed to our community through the activities described on this page. The central careers service also organises: the big careers fair in Manchester Central every autumn, see the Big Careers Fair a smaller careers fair in Fallowfield Armitage centre in May hundreds of other employer events on campus during term time (Birchall 2020b) 2.3 Drop-in sessions If you aren’t willing or able to exhibit at careers fairs, we also run ad-hoc drop-in sessions where employers can come in and set up a stand in the foyer to talk to computer science students informally on their way to and from lectures. These usually happen during lunch in term time. If you’re interested in exhibiting at either of these events, please contact the careers and placements officer Mabel Yau. 2.4 Industry Club All employers are welcome to join our industry club mailing list by sending an email to listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk with the the text subscribe cs-industryclub yourfirstname yoursecondname in the body of the email message. The industry club is part of our wider business engagement activities. The mailing list is low-traffic, typically two to three updates per year and an invitation to our annual industry club meeting. We promise not to spam you or sell your email details on to third parties. 2.5 Industrial mentoring The Industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers allows employers meet students during code review sessions. 2.6 Co-supervised projects If you would like to co-supervise a project student in collaboration with an academic member of staff, there are several options. The best option depends on the domain, level and duration of the project: Bachelors projects: these are completed in the final year of a Bachelors degree and last for six months, starting in September and finishing in March. Projects are proposed (and offered to students) in March and start in September of the same year. Masters projects: again these are six months in duration but start in March and finish in September. Projects are proposed (and offered to students) in the preceding November. PhD projects: For industrially sponsored or co-supervised projects, speak to the research office at cs.manchester.ac.uk/research. Knowledge Transfer Partnerships: We have a range of KTPs, speak to the research office for details Impact Acceleration Accounts: We have a range of IAAs, speak to the research office for details For Bachelors and Masters projects, you can contact academic members of staff directly, or speak to Tim Morris (final year project lead) or Caroline Jay, who leads our postgraduate taught (Masters) courses. 2.7 The Wednesday Waggle During term time, we highlight events and vacancies for Computer Science students from a wide range of sources in a weekly newsletter called the Wednesday Waggle 🐝. This goes out to around ~1000 Bachelors and Masters students in Manchester each week. If you have vacancies or events you would like our students to know about, get in touch with us or contact the careers service. 2.8 Join the community There is a thriving community of engineers and entrepreneurs in Manchester and across the North of England. One of the best ways to recruit engineers and scientists is to join and contribute to the community. Get involved in events, sponsor a hackathon, deliver a guest lecture, host your own event or become a software engineering mentor. Employers who engage early and often are much more likely to get something back. As an employer, you may also be interested in events run by: The Institute of Student Employers (ISE) The Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS) The Work Based and Placement Learning Association (ASET) If you’re a startup new to employment, you may find the guide at gov.uk/employ-someone useful. 2.9 Buzzing! At peak times, we can get very busy with many concurrent employer events on campus. (Birchall 2020b) Please be patient and persistent if we do not reply immediately. Unfortunately, we are not always able to respond to everyone because our students, staff and space are all finite resources. We give priority to employers that have already given their time and expertise to our community. Figure 2.3: According to highfliers.co.uk, the University of Manchester is the most targeted University in the UK by the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers (Birchall 2020b) 2.10 Employability We are working hard to improve the employability of students because while having a Computer Science is necessary for some jobs, it is not sufficient. (Anonymous 2013; Shadbolt 2016; Fincher and Finlay 2016; Fincher, Finlay, and Davies 2017) Over the last decade we have been successful in more than doubling the number of our students going on year long placements in industry. This is a win-win-win situtation for: Students: benefit from a broader education, and develop social and non-cognitive skills that can be challenging to teach and learn in a purely academic environment. This is known as the winning personality (Vries and Rentfrow 2016). Employers: placements are a cost-effective way for employers to recruit (and retain) graduate talent Universities: produce better graduates (Mandilaras 2004) with broader and deeper skills, who earn more and get better jobs (Vries and Rentfrow 2016). Well paid placements can also facilitate social mobility. (Wang and Crawford 2018) year placement started No. of Computer Science undergraduate students on placement 2008 35 2009 31 2010 45 2011 42 2012 45 2013 70 2014 54 2015 70 2016 65 2017 100 2018 97 2019 110 2020 88 In 2019 our students have secured year long placements at Accenture, Agilent Technologies, Amazon (2), AND Digital, Apadmi (5), Arggo, ARM (5), Autodesk, AVL Powertrain, BAML, the BBC (2), Biorelate, BJSS, Bloomberg (2), BMW Mini, Bsquare Controls (2), BT, Cantarus (3), Celtra, CERN (3), Codethink, d3t, Elysian Systems, Feral Interactive (2), Fidelity, FiveAI, HMRC, IBM (2), Imagination Technologies, Intel (4), ISA Software (2), JP Morgan (4), Keysight Technologies, KPMG (1), Matillion (4), McAfee (2), Mentor Graphics (4), Monoprix, Morgan Stanley (2), NCC Group, Nokia, Nomura, Novacoast (2), Ocado (3), PA Consulting, PwC, Schlumberger, ServiceNow, Siemens (3), Soda Software, SteamaCo, The Hut Group (10), The Start Up Factory (2), Uber, Visa and Vodafone. There’s still more we can do to improve the employability of our graduates. If you’d like to help our graduates become more employable, get in touch.

(Fincher and Robins 2019; Biggs and Tang 2011; Fry, Ketteridge, and Marshall 2014) I’m interested in methods that can improve learning and student experience using techniques like coding your future, journal clubbing, industrial mentoring, live music, working with schools, vertical tutoring, editing Wikipedia and more. Figure 3.1: Too many educational practices are not backed up by good evidence that they actually work. More evidence is needed to support many of the claims made about effective pedagogy.

To that end: I’m an active member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and it’s Special Interest Group (SIG) in Computer Science Education (sigcse.org). In 2020 I founded the ACM SIGCSE journal club and chair the monthly Manchester meetup. Anyone is welcome to join, see sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/join-us I serve on the program committee of the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UIKICER) conference, on the board of UK ACM SIGCSE and have served on the program committee for Computing Education &amp; Practice (CEP) conference at Durham University 3.2 Industrial mentoring Since we started the industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers in 2015, more than 1000 students have been through the mentoring scheme with 250 students taking the course every year. We are very grateful for continued support from our industrial partners in making this happen. Mentors meet with a group of six second year students for two one hour meetings and do some gentle code review of their gitlab repository, as they start to fix bugs and add features to a large open source software project. You don’t need to be an expert in the tools students are using (Java, Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, JUnit and Ant) it is more about the general process (and politics) of building and testing high quality software in large and distributed teams, than the specifics of the codebase (https://stendhalgame.org/) we happen to be using. Mentors are typically software engineers, both junior and senior. 3.3 Vertical tutoring We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) scheme, see vertical tutoring for details. (Barnard 2010; Drury 2013) 3.4 Coderdojo &amp; Code Club I’m a volunteer at coderdojo.com (Ward 2016). Coder dojos are local community engineering clubs for young people; with several other volunteers I help out at CoderDojo North West. We meet once a month to help young people broaden their digital and computational horizons. Previously I lead an after school CodeClub as part of a global network of free coding clubs for 9–13 year olds. (Smith, Sutcliffe, and Sandvik 2014) As with coderdojo, the aim is to have fun using Scratch, (Resnick et al. 2009) python and other interesting technology we can get our hands on including Raspberry Pi, (Halfacree 2020) Micro:bits, (Sentance et al. 2017) LEGO® MINDSTORMS®, (Papert 1980; Klassner and Anderson 2003) Oculus Rift, Sonic Pi (Aaron, Blackwell, and Burnard 2016) and CodeBug etc. 3.5 Wikipedia Wikipedia and wikidata.org (Vrandečić and Krötzsch 2014; Turki et al. 2019) are powerful tools for improving both digital skills and communication skills, regardless of your age or level of computer literacy, (Proffitt 2018; Reagle Jr. 2010; Littlejohn et al. 2019) particularly in the following areas: Literacy generally, the ability to read and write in any natural language. The literacy skills of some engineers and scientists leaves plenty of room for improvement, but literacy has many overlapping dimensions including: Data literacy the ability to read and write (data) Digital literacy the ability to read and write (digitally) Computer literacy the ability to read and write (using a computer) Information literacy the ability to read and write (information) Scientific literacy the ability to read and write (science). How many people do you know who unashamedly proclaim their scientific or mathematical illiteracy? (Stacey 2009; Gowers 2016; Garner 2012) As an experienced and long serving editor of Wikipedia since 2004, I organise and participate in Wikipedia training events which recruit new Wikipedia editors. Some recent examples include: 2020-06-24 Wikipedia: Women, War and Peace run in collaboration with the Imperial War Museums’ War and Conflict Subject Specialist Network, with support from the Arts Council England and Art Fund. 2020-02-26 Wikimedia in Education UK Summit, Coventry University #wikiedu20 2019-11-22 Training of Trainers (ToT) workshop, University of Glasgow 2019-10-19 Learn to edit Wikipedia with Ada Lovelace, Sackville Street Building, University of Manchester (Mohammad-Qureshi and Hull 2019) 2019-10-12 Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon with Zebra Hub HQ, Pankhurst Centre, Manchester 2017-10-13 Physiology Friday, Hodgkin Huxley House, Farringdon, London (Hull 2017) 2015-09-02 First Wikipedia Science Conference #wikisci, Wellcome Collection, London, NW1 (Hull 2015; Hodson 2015) More information on past and future events like this can be found at: wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Duncan.Hull 3.6 Tuning complete Tuning complete are a musical collective from Manchester, Lancashire 🌹, named after the famous Computer Scientist Alan Tuning. We use his eponymous Tuning machine to make music which is quality assured using the Tuning test. As of 2020, our lineup includes the following artists: Jez Lloyd: Bachelor of Music, DJ and backing vocals Steve Furber: six string guitar and bass Justin Timberfake: lead vocals, lead dancer Billie Fakish: guest vocalist Duncan Hull: MC, synth (MicroKORG), drum machine (Sonic Pi) and embarrassing dad dancing (Facepalm 2015) Theoretically, we are a Turing Complete band. (Turing 1937; Brailsford 2005) Artistically, this means that what we lack in youth, good looks, fame, fortune, fashion sense, fanbase and back catalogue we compensate for with: 🤓 Musical geekery (Fauvel, Flood, and Wilson 2006; Harkleroad 2006) 🤓 Mathematical geekery (Rosenthal 2005) 🤓 Computer geekery (Aaron, Blackwell, and Burnard 2016) Figure 3.2: Tuning Complete consists of Jez Lloyd, Steve Furber, Justin Timberfake and me. We played our debut gigs to packed theatres of over 200 second year &amp; first year undergraduate computer science students in the autumn of 2019 and are currently planning future live events while writing a (hopefully) lucrative hit single, working title: #LivingTheDream. If you would like to book our services for your next event, hackathon, wedding, bar mitzvah etc, please contact our agent Mrs. Kilburn shown in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.3: Mrs. Kilburn is our manager, booking agent and promoter. She is the power behind our boy band throne, so all bookings must be approved and scheduled by her office. Please do not approach band members directly with gig requests or offers of marriage, we are all answered for! 3.7 Publications Informal publications can be found on my sporadically updated blog duncan.hull.name/lablog Formal peer-reviewed publications can be found on DBLP, ORCID, Google Scholar, the ACM Digital Library, Wikidata etc: dblp.org/pid/h/DuncanHull wikidata.org/wiki/Q47012855 dl.acm.org/profile/81350580198 orcid.org/0000-0003-2387-503X europepmc.org/authors/0000-0003-2387-503X profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0003-2387-503X scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDJ-t7IAAAAJ According to Google scholar, my most cited papers are on: Apache Taverna, published in Nucleic Acids Research (Hull et al. 2006) Another Taverna paper, published in Concurrency and Computation (Oinn et al. 2006) A paper on modelling human metabolism, published in Nature Biotechnology (Thiele et al. 2013) A review of tools for managing large bibliographies, published in PLOS Computational Biology (Hull, Pettifer, and Kell 2008) The first paper for which I was formally acknowledged was on simulated environmental change in the sub-arctic published in New Phytologist (Potter et al. 1995).

References "],["vertical-tutoring.html", "Chapter 4 Vertical tutoring 4.1 Full stack mentoring 4.2 What is it good for? 4.3 How long will all this take?", " Chapter 4 Vertical tutoring We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) system for undergraduate students. VT is already widespread in secondary education, (Barnard 2010; Drury 2013) but as far as we know has not been widely used in higher education. Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) pass.manchester.ac.uk, (May and Danino 2020) vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative from one of each year of undergraduate study combined with alumni. Figure 4.1: Conventional horizontal tutor groups (shown in black) bring together a group of students in the same year. For example, year 1 students meet as a small group once per week during term time with their tutor. Vertical tutor groups (shown in red) are made of of one student from each year and an alumni. Vertical tutor groups extend the idea of PASS, to full stack mentoring, crossing all levels 4.1 Full stack mentoring A vertical tutor group will typically contain five members as shown in Figure 4.1. The group meets physically where possible, or virtually via a slack channel which consists of: One first year student One second year student One penultimate year student (out on industrial placement) One final year student (returned from placement or summer internship) One member of our alumni, recent graduate or via network.manchester.ac.uk Vertical tutor groups meet twice per semester. It is very unlikely that a free timetable slot for all years and alumni can be found during normal office hours, because of the complexities of timetabling. So evenings will be likely to work best. Where possible, tutor groups will meet face to face, with remote members (e.g. placement students and alumni) typically joining virtually by slack or similar. 4.2 What is it good for? Vertical tutoring is an attractive idea but does it actually work? If so, how? What is it useful for? We would like to find out: If there is any appetite for vertical tutoring amongst students and alumni How it could work e.g. with slack.com or discord etc? How many times can/should vertical tutor groups meet? Twice per semester? More frequently? Less frequently? What are suitable topics for discussion in a vertical tutorial? Careers, wellbeing, networking etc What kind of specialist groups could be useful e.g. all female groups, research focussed tutorial groups (with MSc &amp; PhD students), ordinary “vanilla” groups etc How much can we breakdown entrenched year groups that persist throughout education (Robinson 2006) What might the benefits be? (Robinson 2010) As this is an experiment, students have been selected on a voluntary basis. If you are a student or former student and would like to get involved, let me know. 4.3 How long will all this take? We ask that vertical tutees commit to: two one hour sessions per semester allowing time for setup and administration, slack channels, scheduling suitable times and dates with your group Two hours of time for feedback and review after each semester, by email survey References "],["coding-their-future.html", "Chapter 5 Coding their future 5.1 Guidance for teachers 5.2 Guidance for students 5.3 Getting a head start", " Chapter 5 Coding their future Coding their future is a collaboration &amp; partnership between secondary schools and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester.

In return, the school provides our undergraduate students with a safe and supportive environment in which to teach which extends and augments your current curriculum. This can either be an after school, extension / lunchtime club or during scheduled lesson time, typically between year 7 and 13. This is similar to the Undergraduate Ambassador Scheme (UAS), (Singh 2005; Cooper and D’Inverno 2005) and school placements (Moller and Powell 2019) except students work is assessed using our final year project framework. (Morris 2019a, 2019b) Since these projects were started in 2012, our students have worked with a range of schools in the private and public sector, both selective and non-selective, co-educational and single-sex including: Fairfield High School for Girls, Droylsden Trinity CofE High School, Central Manchester University Technical College (UTC) \\(@\\)MediaCityUK, Salford Manchester Communication Academy, Harpurhey The Barlow RC High School, Didsbury William Hulme Grammar School, Whalley Range Cheadle Hulme High School, (CHHS) Stockport Laurus Cheadle Hulme, Stockport Knutsford Academy, Knutsford Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Trafford Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Trafford Manchester Grammar School (MGS), Fallowfield The projects were setup by Duncan Hull and David Rydeheard (who retired in 2019), and are now run and supervised by Duncan. We hope to transfer ideas between private and public sector, as there are lots of open questions about how Computer Science should be taught. (Sentance, Barendsen, and Schulte 2018; Sentance 2018; Stephenson 2018; Fincher and Petre 2004) To find out more, see the guidance for teachers and guidance for students below. 5.1 Guidance for teachers Figure 5.2: An abundance of free software and relatively cheap new hardware like the Raspberry Pi (Halfacree 2020), Microbit, (Sentance et al. 2017) Makey Makey [Rogers et al.

(Bate 2019)) Our aim is to support the teaching and learning of Computer Science in your school and to help engage schoolchildren in the subject. This page describes what we can provide you with and what we expect to get in return. 5.1.1 What the University is offering your school The University of Manchester will provide your school or college with at least one student ambassador with some relevant training who has completed two years of study in Computer Science and has: A good knowledge of, and enthusiasm for Computer Science Completed Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) clearance An interest in teaching and working with young people Achieved a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st class degree in their second year 5.1.2 What the University expects from your school In return, we expect that the school provides the undergraduate student with: Opportunities to engage with a classroom or after school club of children as a Teaching Assistant (TA). This is typically for around one or two hours during term time. Initially, this could be through classroom observation and teacher assistance, culminating in the student delivering at least one lesson (and potentially a series of lessons) with your support and guidance Advice, suggestions, feedback, assessment and encouragement from you to suggest the kinds of resources that would be useful, appropriate or engaging for the Computer Science curriculum you are teaching Classroom and behaviour management: the students are not trained teachers and will be relying on your expertise in classroom and behaviour management. 5.1.3 Resources developed by students Undergraduates typically develop a range of resources. The project will involve development of a computer-based system together with supporting activities, lessons and resources. The resource could be a variety of things including, a game, robotics, animations, hardware (Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc) or software, intended to enthuse school students at one of the Key stages 3 or 4 about fundamental concepts in computing preferably linked to one of the new Computer Science curricula. 5.1.4 Project timing The projects run for 6 months from September to March, divided into three phases. September to October Observation in the classroom teaching by the student around once per week. Development of ideas for an educational tool that the student will make, with the advice of the classroom teacher November to January From November to January, our students develop and tests prototype tool (or tools) with the supporting material, this can happen sooner for students who make a quick start to the project. February to April From February to April, our students are expected to liaise closely with teachers to develop an educational tool that will be of use in the classroom using teachers’ suggestions as to what is appropriate to build. Students will spend some time in a classroom working closely with teachers and students developing and delivering a new resource for teaching. More details on final year projects can be found in COMP300, the undergraduates already know what is required from their project 5.1.5 Assessment and monitoring Formal supervision and mentoring is undertaken by the university (Duncan and David), but we will ask you to fill in a one page form on your assessment of their progress during their time at your school, we very much value your input and hope that these projects can beneficial for both your school and the University. We don’t want to burden you with unnecessary bureaucracy that all teachers battle with! 5.2 Guidance for students Figure 5.3: Lecture theatre 1.1 (LT 1.1) in Kilburn full of first year students So why would you, an undergraduate student, want to work on an education project in secondary school? The UK government would like Computer Science should be taught in all secondary schools in the UK. (Furber 2017) However, in many UK schools there is a shortage of teachers who are trained in Computer Science, consequently, many teachers find themselves being asked to teach a subject they may know little about. (Furber 2012) Undergraduate students can make a significant difference here, by supporting teachers in the classroom to create and deliver new classroom resources in Computer Science. (Hull 2020a) In addition, undergraduate students will have the chance to: develop leadership skills in the classroom gain valuable experience of working on “real world” problems in a stimulating environment improve your communication skills, especially spoken communication work as part of a team (in the school) and join a small group of like-minded undergraduate students (in the University) working on related projects test your knowledge &amp; technical ability in a challenging and dynamic environment working with young people last, but not least, there is a good chance you will have lots of fun and have a rewarding experience of teaching make yourself more employable by doing all of the above 5.2.1 Who is involved? Initially, the number of undergraduate students involved in these projects will be less than ten. We also require that you will have a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st in your second year exams. Projects are co-supervised by Duncan with additional supervision from an experienced member of teaching staff at a participating school. We have carefully selected schools in Manchester that are relatively easy for you to get to, are already teaching Computer Science and have supportive staff and teachers in place to help you. You will be expected to work directly with school children with the support of the teaching staff in your school. Schools we have worked with are all the Manchester area. 5.2.2 What will the educational projects be expected to deliver? You will be expected to work closely with the teacher to develop resources that engage students with one or more aspects of the new Computer Science curriculum at an appropriate key stage. This is usually key stage 3, key stage 4 or key stage 5 ages 11-18. complement and extend the schools current provision for computer science in the school During the project you will be spending a significant amount of time in the classroom, visiting your school every week during school term time throughout the duration of your project to develop resources. These must include a computer-based teaching tool which may use, for example, Raspberry Pi’s, visual aids, demonstrations, videos, online questionnaires, formative feedback, games, drones, robotics, music, (Aaron, Blackwell, and Burnard 2016) algorithms (Kubica 2012) or even just the command line (Smedley 2019) etc.2 In addition, guidance on classroom use, such as a lesson or series of lessons to support the tool. Remember that you don’t actually need a computer, see Computer Science Unplugged: Computer Science without a Computer. (Bell and Vahrenhold 2018) All deliverables for standard final year projects will be expected of these projects including: first semester presentation demonstration of the resource being used in the classroom final written report Assessments for these projects will be as for standard projects, (Morris 2019a, 2019b) but part of the evaluation of the project will be a classroom demonstration, a description and evaluation of which should be included in your final report. 5.2.3 Blended learning COVID 19 is revolutionising teaching, from primary and secondary school right through to higher education. You need to get clued up on blended learning. Start with Moving to Blended Learning, Part 1: Terminology and Concepts, then take a look the video below with Steve Pettifer explaining techniques for slides that work for blended learning videos: When you teach, think about how you can support students before and after your time in the classroom. 5.2.4 When do the projects start and finish? Projects start annually in September and are handed at Easter time, see final year project guidelines. For more information contact Duncan Hull. 5.3 Getting a head start So you’ve selected Coding their future as your third year project and now you are ready to get started. There are plenty of resources to help you prepare and improve your effectiveness in the classroom. Work with young people Any experience of working with young people will be beneficial, if you have the time and opportunity over the summer you can get some experience of working with young people for example through codeclub.org and coderdojo.com It doesn’t have to be coding either, you could get involved with any activities such as sporting events or others, see find-volunteering.manchester.ac.uk/ Read around There are three really articles and books to help you get started Teaching Computing (Simmons and Hawkins 2015) by Carl Simmons &amp; Claire Hawkins, is aimed at teachers of computing, particularly trainee computer science teachers. e-book available here, University of Manchester login required Computer Science Education (Sentance, Barendsen, and Schulte 2018) edited by Sue Sentance, Erik Barendsen and Carsten Schulte.

A.1 Who can provide a reference for me? A.2 Should I ask permission from my referee? A.3 What is a reference for? A.4 How can I help my referee? A.5 Can I have a copy of my reference?", " A Will you write a reference for me? As employability tutor, I get asked to write lots references for students applying for jobs and further study. I’m happy to do this if you’ve been personal tutee or I’ve worked with you closely outside of ordinary teaching. However, it’s impossible to for me to say YES to every request for a reference. For students I haven’t worked with, it is difficult to do, because all I can confirm is facts (attendance, academic marks, degree program) without opinions which doesn’t make for a very compelling reference. Whoever agrees to be your referee, make sure you read and understand the following: A.1 Who can provide a reference for me? The best person to provide a reference for you is somebody who knows you, such as your personal tutor. See the careers service guide what are references and how should I choose a referee? and guidance to staff providing references for students from the University of Manchester, which gives extra context. It is good to have references from different sources, so if you are providing several referees try to pick people from inside and outside the University. Within the University, this is most likely to be your tutor: Your personal tutor from year one Your personal tutor from year two (if different to first year) Your Industrial Experience (IE) tutor (sometimes that’s me) Your third year project supervisor Your Masters project supervisor Anyone else who knows you personally If you ask somebody who does not know you very well to write a reference for you, all that they are able to do in a reference is confirm rather dull facts such as your grades, your attendance, start date and graduation date. As I’ve already said, this does not make for a very useful reference. A.2 Should I ask permission from my referee? You should always ask the person providing your reference. A.3 What is a reference for? References have two main purposes: Providing and confirming facts to give a factual account, e.g. of academic record, attendance, etc to confirm the accuracy of statements made in an application Providing opinions to give the referee’s opinion as to the candidate’s suitability for the post/course in question, and his/her potential for the future A.4 How can I help my referee? It can make it much easier for your referee if you provide them with information you would like them to mention in your reference. This might include information about your character, projects you have completed or specific aspects of your academic performance. Providing an up to date CV also helps your referee. A.5 Can I have a copy of my reference? It is unusual for a referee to provide a reference directly to its subject (that’s you). Typically, a referee is asked to provide a reference for a student (or former student) directly by the organisation concerned. For example, if you’re applying for postgraduate study, the reference request will be sent by the University directly to your referees email address, who will usually respond by clicking on a link to upload the reference document. You can make a request to see your reference under data protection law. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
