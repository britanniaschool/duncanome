["index.html", "Dr. Duncan Hull About Background Tools", " Dr. Duncan Hull About I am a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester where I lead the Industrial Experience (IE) program. Every year, around 100 of our undergraduate students spend a year in industry as intercalated part of their degree. I teach on various undergraduate courses, tutorials and supervise final year and masters extended projects. I serve as second year tutor and employability tutor. If you are an employer who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please get in touch. During term time, we highlight opportunities from a wide range of sources via the Wednesday Waggle, a weekly newsletter edited by Mabel Yau and myself. Background My background is a mixture of Natural Science (Plant Sciences, BSc) and Computer Science (MSc &amp; PhD). I‚Äôve worked as a consultant and developer of web applications for various organisations including BBC Monitoring, The Ford Motor Company and the National Health Service (NHS). While working on the Apache Taverna, myGrid and Refine project I completed a PhD and postdoc in Bioinformatics at the University of Manchester. More recently, I was also employed as a software engineer (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest: ChEBI) of a biochemical database by the European Bioinformatics Institute (ebi.ac.uk) on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Cambridge, UK. I have taught various flavours of Science to primary &amp; secondary school children, sixth formers, undergraduates &amp; postgraduates in England and India.

I could have (should have?) used blogdown and Hugo, but opted for bookdown because it is much less bloated easier to use (IMHO). "],

The idea is fairly widespread in secondary education (see verticaltutoring.org), but as far as we know has not been used fully in higher education. Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) pass.manchester.ac.uk, vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative of several years and combined with alumni.
