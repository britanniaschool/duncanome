# Research {#research}

My research interests are in [Computer Science Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science_education) and [pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy). [@JohnBiggs2011; @Fry2014] I'm interested in methods that can deliver outstanding learning and student experience using innovative techniques like [vertical tutoring], [industrial mentoring](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/), [live music][tuning complete], [working with schools][coding their future], [editing Wikipedia][wikipedia and Literacy] and more.

## SIGCSE
Computer Science has only been taught to undergraduates in the UK for 50 short years [@babygrowsup], so there's lots of open questions about how to teach both the practical and theoretical aspects of the subject. To that end:

* I'm an [active member](https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350580198) of the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) in Computer Science Education ([SIGCSE.org](https://sigcse.org)).
* As part of that I founded and chair a [journal club](https://duncan.hull.name/2019/07/17/sigcse-journal-club/) for educators in Manchester, if you'd like to join us, subscribe to the mailing list by emailing listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk with the text **subscribe sigcse-journal-club yourfirstname yoursecondname** in the body of your message
* I'm serving on the program committee for [Computing Education & Practice (CEP)](http://community.dur.ac.uk/cep.conference) conference at Durham University in 2020.

## Industrial mentoring
Since we started the [Industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/) in 2015, more than 1000 students have been through the mentoring scheme with 250 students taking the course every year. We are very grateful for continued support from our industrial partners in making this happen.

Mentors meet with a group of six second year students for two one hour meetings and do some gentle code review of their gitlab repository, as they start to fix bugs and add features to a large open source software project. You donâ€™t *need* to be an expert in the tools students are using (Java, Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, JUnit and Ant) it is more about the general process (and politics) of building and testing high quality software in large and distributed teams, than the specifics of the codebase (https://stendhalgame.org/) we happen to be using. Mentors are typically software engineers, both junior and senior.

## Vertical tutoring
We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) scheme, see [vertical tutoring] for details. [@vtbernard; @druryvert]

## Code Club {#codeclub}
I lead an after school [CodeClub](https://codeclub.org) as part of a global network of free coding clubs for 9--13 year olds. [@codeclub] The aim is to have fun using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [@Resnick2009] python and other interesting technology we can get our hands on including [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [@raspberrypi] [Micro:bits](https://microbit.org/), [@Sentance2017] [LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMSÂ®](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/mindstorms), [@Papert1980; @Klassner2003] [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com), [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) [@Aaron2016] and [CodeBug](http://www.codebug.org.uk/) etc.

## Wikipedia and literacy {#wikipedia}
Wikipedia and [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org) [@Vrandecic2014; @Turki2019] are powerful tools for improving both digital skills and communication skills, regardless of your age or level of computer literacy, [@Proffitt2018; @goodfaith; @Littlejohn2019] particularly in the following areas:

* [Literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy) generally, the ability to read and write in any natural language. The literacy skills of some engineers and scientists leaves plenty of room for improvement, but literacy has many overlapping dimensions including:
  + [Data literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_literacy) the ability to read and write (data)
  + [Digital literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy) the ability to read and write (digitally)
  + [Computer literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_literacy) the ability to read and write (using a computer)
  + [Information literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy) the ability to read and write (information)
  + [Scientific literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literacy) the ability to read and write (science). How many people do you know who _unashamedly_ proclaim their scientific or mathematical illiteracy? [@nevergoodatmaths; @gowersproblem; @mathillit]

As an experienced and long serving editor of Wikipedia since 2004, I organise and participate in [Wikipedia training events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon) which recruit new Wikipedia editors. Some recent examples include:

1. 2019-11-22 [Training of Trainers (ToT) workshop, University of Glasgow](https://duncan.hull.name/2019/12/10/glasgow/)

## Tuning complete
Tuning complete are a [musical collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_collective) and (mostly) [boy band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band) from [Manchester, Lancashire ðŸŒ¹](https://duncan.hull.name/2019/07/05/mancashire/), named after the famous Computer Scientist [Alan Tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). We use his eponymous [Tuning machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) to make music which is quality assured using the [Tuning test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). As of 2020, our lineup includes the following artists:

* [Jez Lloyd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jez-lloyd-84077069): Bachelor of Music, DJ and backing vocals
* [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber): six string guitar and bass
* [Justin Timberfake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake): lead vocals, lead dancer
* Duncan Hull: MC, synth ([MicroKORG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroKORG)), drum machine ([Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)) and embarrassing dad dancing [@daddancing]

Theoretically, we are a [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) band. [@Turing1937; @turingcomplete] Artistically, this means that what we lack in youth, good looks, fame, fortune, fashion sense, fanbase and back catalogue we compensate for with:

ðŸ¤“ Musical geekery [@musicnmaths]  
ðŸ¤“ Mathematical geekery [@plusmaths]   
ðŸ¤“ Computer geekery [@Aaron2016]

```{r beatles-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.cap='Tuning Complete consists of Jez Lloyd, Steve Furber, Justin Timberfake and me.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tuning-complete.jpg")
```

We played our debut gigs to packed theatres of over 200 second year & first year undergraduate computer science students in the autumn of 2019 and are currently planning future live events while writing a (hopefully) lucrative hit single, working title: [#LivingTheDream](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LivingTheDream). If you would like to book our services for your next event, hackathon, wedding, bar mitzvah etc, please contact our agent Mrs. Kilburn shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mrskilburn-fig).

```{r mrskilburn-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.cap='Mrs. Kilburn is our manager, booking agent and promoter. She is the power behind our boy band throne, so all bookings must be approved and scheduled by her office. Please do not approach band members directly with gig requests or offers of marriage, we are all answered for!'}
