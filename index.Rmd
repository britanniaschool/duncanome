Hello, my name is Duncan. I'm a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) where I lead the [Industrial Experience (IE)](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/) program. This elective course has over 100 students every year working for 12 months in industry in the penultimate year of their degree. üéì

I [teach][Students] undergraduate courses, supervise tutorials, final year projects and masters projects. I serve as [second year tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year2/), employability tutor, on the [mitigating circumstances](http://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/study-support/mitigating-circumstances/) committee and the exam board. I'm interested in [better teaching and learning methods][Research], for example using innovative techniques like [vertical tutoring] and [industrial mentoring](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/) to improve learning and the student experience.  

If you are an [employer][Employers] who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please [get in touch][Contact]. During term time, we highlight opportunities for students via the [Wednesday Waggle](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about). üêù

## Background {-}

My [background](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull) is a mixture of Natural Sciences ([Plant Sciences, BSc](http://www.plantsciences.manchester.ac.uk/)), Computer Science ([MSc](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/msc2003.html) & PhD) and software engineering. I‚Äôve worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including [BBC Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring), the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS). While working on the [Apache Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna), [myGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid) and [Refine project](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/) I completed a [PhD](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578) and [postdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) in [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) at the University of Manchester. More recently, I was employed as a software engineer of a biochemical database ([Chemical Entities of Biological Interest: ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/)) in Cambridge, UK at the European Bioinformatics Institute ([ebi.ac.uk](https://www.ebi.ac.uk)). üá™üá∫

I have taught english, maths, science and engineering from primary level to postgraduate level. In 2011, I completed a [PGCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) and trained at [non-selective state-funded schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-funded_schools_(England)) in [Swindon](https://www.lydiardparkacademy.org.uk/), [Shaftesbury](https://shaftesburyschool.co.uk/) and [Stockport](https://www.st-annes.stockport.sch.uk/). I enjoy the challenge of teaching and over the last 30 years, have taught primary & secondary school children ([K--12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%9312)), undergraduates & postgraduates in the UK, India and America. üá¨üáßüáÆüá≥üá∫üá∏
