["index.html", "Dr. Duncan Hull About Background Tools", " Dr. Duncan Hull About Hello, my name is Duncan. I‚Äôm a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester where I lead the Industrial Experience (IE) program. This elective course has over 100 students every year working for 12 months in industry in the penultimate year of their degree. üéì I teach undergraduate courses, supervise tutorials, final year projects and masters projects. I serve as second year tutor, employability tutor, on the mitigating circumstances committee and the exam board. I‚Äôm interested in better teaching and learning methods, for example using innovative techniques like vertical tutoring and industrial mentoring to improve learning and the student experience. If you are an employer who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please get in touch. During term time, we highlight opportunities for students via the Wednesday Waggle. üêù Background My background is a mixture of Natural Sciences (Plant Sciences, BSc), Computer Science (MSc &amp; PhD) and software engineering. I‚Äôve worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including BBC Monitoring, the Ford Motor Company and the National Health Service (NHS). While working on the Apache Taverna, myGrid and Refine project I completed a PhD and postdoc in Bioinformatics at the University of Manchester. More recently, I was employed as a software engineer of a biochemical database (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest: ChEBI) in Cambridge, UK at the European Bioinformatics Institute (ebi.ac.uk). üá™üá∫ I have taught english, maths, science and engineering from primary level to postgraduate level. In 2011, I completed a PGCE at the University of Bath and trained at non-selective state-funded schools in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport. I enjoy the challenge of teaching and over the last 30 years, have taught primary &amp; secondary school children (K‚Äì12), undergraduates &amp; postgraduates in the UK, India and America. üá¨üáßüáÆüá≥üá∫üá∏ Tools This website is written in R markdown and built using bookdown, gitbook, JabRef, JavaScript, knitr, LaTeX, pandoc, RStudio and Visual Studio Code. Thanks to Yihui Xie for the tools. The source is available on github. I could have (should have?) used blogdown and Hugo, but opted for bookdown because it is much less bloated easier to use. üî® "],

Whatever stage you are at, it is a good idea to debug your CV, LinkedIn, job search, life etc before you show it to a potential employer. These sessions are open to undergraduate (BSc, BEng) and postgradautes (MSc and PhD).

I‚Äôm proud to have served as a judge of the fantastic studenthack.com and greatunihack.com since they started in 2014. These hackathons are organised by UniCS, a student-led tech society formerly known as HackSoc and CSSoc. "],

According to highfliers.co.uk, the University of Manchester is one of the most targeted Universities in the UK by the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers. We can do better, for example, by engaging more with new employers, especially those in Manchester (see git.io/manc). 2.1 Recruiting students If you are recruiting computer scientists and software engineers as a summer interns, placement students or as graduates please get in touch with me or Mabel Yau (careers and placements officer). We typically have around 250 undergraduate students graduating annually, alongside a smaller number of Masters and PhD students. If you are looking to recruit students from related degree disciplines like Physics, Maths, Chemistry, MACE and EEE you should talk to the Careers Service centrally at careers.manchester.ac.uk 2.2 Careers fairs Our annual Computer Science careers fair is held the Kilburn building in autumn, we typically have around 30 employers exhibited over two days. We also run drop-in sessions where employers can come in and set up a stand in the foyer to talk to students informally on their way to and from lectures, usually during lunch in term time. If you‚Äôre interested in exhibiting at either of these, please contact the careers and placements officer Mabel Yau. The central careers service also organises the big careers fair in Manchester Central every autumn, see the Big Careers Fair a smaller careers fair in Fallowfield Armitage centre in May many other employer events on campus during term time 2.3 Industry Club Employers are welcome to join our industry club mailing list by sending an email to listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk with the the text subscribe cs-industryclub yourfirstname yoursecondname in the body of your message. You will receive two to three updates per year and an invitation to our industry club meetings which usually happen every year. We promise not to spam you or sell your details on to third parties. 2.4 The Wednesday Waggle During term time, we highlight events and vacancies from a wide range of sources to students via the Wednesday Waggle.

I am particularly interested in better teaching and learning methods that help students to develop skills they need for the wide range of careers they go onto after graduation. This includes ‚Äúhard‚Äù technical and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù non-technical skills. Figure 3.1: Too many educational practices are not backed up by good evidence that they actually work.

Wikipedian Protester cartoon by Randall Munroe at xkcd.com/285 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License 3.1 SIGCSE In the UK we have only been teaching Computer Science to undergraduates for 50 short years, so there‚Äôs lots of open questions about how to teach both the practical and theoretical aspects of the subject. To that end: I‚Äôm an active member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE.org).

["vertical-tutoring.html", "4 Vertical tutoring 4.1 Full stack mentoring 4.2 What is good for?", " 4 Vertical tutoring Starting in September 2019, we are experimenting with a vertical tutoring system for undergraduate students. The idea is widespread in secondary education (see verticaltutoring.org), but as far as we know has not been used in higher education. Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) pass.manchester.ac.uk, vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative from one of each year of undergraduate study combined with alumni. 4.1 Full stack mentoring A vertical tutor group will typically contain five members as shown in Figure~??. The group meets physically and virtually via a slack channel which consists of: One first year student One second year student One penultimate year student (out on industrial placement) One final year student One member of our alumni via network.manchester.ac.uk Vertical tutor groups meet twice per semester. It is very unlikely that a free timetable slot for all years and alumni can be found during normal office hours, because of the complexities of timetabling. So evenings will be likely to work best. Where possible, tutor groups will meet face to face, with remote members (e.g. placement students and alumni) typically joining virtually by slack or similar. Figure 4.1: Conventional horizontal tutor groups (shown in black) bring together a group of students in the same year. For example, year 1 students meet as a group once per week during term time. Vertical tutor groups (shown in red) are made of of one student from each year and an alumni. Vertical tutor groups extend the idea of PASS, to full stack mentoring, crossing all levels 4.2 What is good for? Vertical tutoring is an attractive idea but does it actually work? If so, how? What is it useful for? We would like to find out: If there is any appetite for vertical tutoring amongst students and alumni How it could work e.g. with slack.com or discordapp.com etc? How many times can/should vertical tutor groups meet? Twice per semester? More frequently? Less frequently? What are suitable topics for discussion in a vertical tutorial? Careers, mental health, networking etc What kind of specialist groups could be useful e.g. all female group , research focussed tutorial group (with MSc &amp; PhD student), ordinary ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù group etc "],
