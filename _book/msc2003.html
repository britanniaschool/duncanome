						</blockquote>

						<p>Computers have been with us for a while, but let's start in 2003: The picture below shows students of the <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/programmes/acs/" title="MSc syllabus, handbook &amp; prospectus - &#x201C;If you can&#x2019;t beat them, join them&#x201D;">MSc Advanced Computer Science - Foundation route</a> class of 2003. The people in the picture are smiling because they are being entertained by <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/manop/management/staff/giordano.shtml" title="Richard Giordano">Richard Giordano</a>, who took this picture while teaching. Most of these people have moved on, although some stayed on to do research including <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horridgm/" title="Matthew Horridge | University of Manchester">Matthew Horridge</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Parkin:Michael.html" title="Michael Parkin | University of Manchester">Michael Parkin</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nashar:Karim.html" title="Karim Nashar | University of Manchester">Karim Nashar</a> and myself (the one in the back row with the dodgy haircut).</p>

						<h2>Class of 1970-something</h2>
						<p>The picture shows Manchester staff and students circa 1970. Most socially well-adjusted people will have little interest in the <a href="http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mu5/mu5.html">MU5 computer</a> that the people in the picture are using. However, a wider audience may be interested in the fantastic Saturday-Night-Fever style boots that the woman on the left of the picture (arrowed) is wearing.</p>

But if <a href="http://www.computer50.org/mark1/kilburn.html" title="Tom Kilburn (1921 - 2001)">Tom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Calland_Williams" title="Frederic Calland Williams (1911 - 1977)">Freddie</a> (see <a href="#c1948" title="class of 1948">class of 1948</a> below) were alive today and had seen Monty Pythons Four Yorkshiremen sketch below...</p>

						<p>...they would probably reply to James:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Memory? Memory! LUXURY....'Ere in Manchester, when we were lads and built computers, we <i>didn't even have any memory</i>. We had to make our own from an <a href="http://www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/williams.html" title="The Williams-Kilburn tube">old bit o' tube</a> we found lying around in t'lab. 'Course it <a href="http://www.computer50.org/mark1/ip-mm1.crt2048.html" title="Storing 2048 bits on a CRT in 1947">only stored 2048 bits</a> and  worked for a few hours. Ohhhh we used to <i>DREAM</i> of havin' 8K of memory.....</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>They may have had to use very primitive memory, but at least Tom and Freddie didn't have to build their <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/treasures/manch2.asp" title="Science Museum London | Manchester Differential Analyser (1935)">computers out of mechanical discs and wheels</a>, or even better <a href="http://www.dalefield.com/nzfmm/magazine/Differential_Analyser.html" title="The Meccano Differential Analyser explained by William Irwin">Meccano</a>! Moving on swiftly, we go back a little further in time, twenty years earlier...</p>

						<p>Armed with some sticky-tape, several empty fairy-liquid bottles, lots of patience and the help of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" title="Alan Mathison Turing">some bloke called Alan Turing</a>, Tom and Freddie built the world's first <i>stored program</i> computer. Was this the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/11/07/baby_computer_40_interview_feature.shtml" title="BBC Manchester | Science and Nature, Baby grows up">world's first computer?</a> Well, it depends on your definition: It is surprisingly <a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/homes/cam/fcomp.shtml" title="Chris Malcom | Who Made the First Computer?">hard to define what counts as a computer and who built the first one</a>. After Tom and Freddie, things were never the same again. The rest, as they say, is history. That computer you are using, wether its a desktop, iPod, mobile phone, Palm, SatNav, washing machine, toaster etc is a direct descendant of the rather strange looking machine in the picture.</p>
						<h3>Numbers speak louder than words</h3>
						<p>What's interesting about the difference between 1948 and now are the changes in the efficiency, size and speed of computers, shown in table below. It's hard to describe in words the difference between 1948 and now, in this case, the numbers speak much louder than words ever could...</p>

						<p>So where is all this going? What about the future? Let's take a <a href="http://www.longnow.com/" title="The Long Now Foundation">longer view</a>, and skip forward from 1948 to 2048...</p>
					</div>
					<div id="c2048">
						<h2>Class of 2048?</h2>
						<p>What will classes in the year 2048 be studying? Well in year 2048, Computer Science won't exist anymore either because:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" title="Richard Phillips Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> said <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/q2007-07-09.html" title="Quote of the Day 2007-07-09">Computer Science isn't actually a Science</a> or
							</li>
							<li>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson" title="Harold Abelson | MIT">Hal Abelson</a> says, &#x201C;<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/" title=" was http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/q2004-01-14.html">Computer Science isn't about Computers</a>&#x201D; or </li>
							<li>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham" title="Paul Graham | Hacker and Painter">Paul Graham</a> says,
								<a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/q2005-08-21.html">There is no such thing as &#x201C;Computer Science&#x201D;</a> or </li>
							<li>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Johnson_%28writer%29" title="George Johnson | Science writer">George Johnson</a> says,
								<a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/q2004-10-05.html">All Science Is Computer Science</a>, a sentiment echoed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" title="Big Bad Bill | Microsoftie"> Microsoftie Bill Gates</a> who also thinks <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/11-15SuperComputing05.aspx" title="Bill Gates | Super Computing 2005-11-05">Computation is Transforming the Sciences</a>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Either way, what is known as &#x201C;Computer Science&#x201D; today will have become so fundamental to many other areas of research, the discipline will naturally become more closely integrated with them. Take Manchester as an example, the <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/fmethods/" title="Formal Methods in Manchester">hard-sums people</a> will join the <a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/" title="School of Mathematics in Manchester">shiny new mathematics department</a>, the architecture geeks and <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/apt/" title="The Advanced Processor Technologies Group in Manchester">hardware nerds</a> will join the <a href="http://www.eps.manchester.ac.uk/" title="Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences in Manchester">engineering</a> department, the <a href="http://www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/research/themes/bioinformatics/" title="Biomedical Informatics in Manchester">Computational Biologists</a> will go and join <a href="http://www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/about/" title="About the Faculty of Life Sciences in Manchester">Life Sciences</a> or <a href="http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/" title="Medicine in Manchester">Medicine</a>, and so on. Of course, I could be very wrong here! As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" title="Niels Henrik David Bohr (1885-1962)">Niels Bohr</a> said:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>&#x201C;Predictions are hard to make, especially about the future.&#x201D;</p>
