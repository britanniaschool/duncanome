# Hello! {-}

Hello, my name is Duncan. I'm a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) where I lead the [Industrial Experience (IE)](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/) program. This elective course has [over 100][employability] students every year working for 12 months in industry in the penultimate (‚Äúsandwich‚Äù) year of their degree. ü•™üéì

I [teach][Students] undergraduate courses, supervise tutorials, final year projects and masters projects. I serve as [second year tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year2/), [employability tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/placement/), while also serving on the [mitigating circumstances](http://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/study-support/mitigating-circumstances/) committee and exam boards. I'm interested in methods that can [deliver outstanding learning and student experience][Research] using innovative techniques like [vertical tutoring], [industrial mentoring](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/), [working with local schools][coding their future], Wikipedia editing and [live music][tuning complete]. üé∏

If you are an [employer][Employers] who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please [get in touch][Contact]. During term time, we highlight opportunities for students in the [Wednesday Waggle](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about). üêù

## Full stack teaching  {-}
Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary & secondary school children ([K--12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%9312)), undergraduates & postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a [Postgraduate Certificate in Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education) (PGCE) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) and worked at co-educational [non-selective state-funded schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-funded_schools_(England)) in Swindon^[Greendown Community School, Swindon, Wiltshire https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greendown_Community_School], Shaftesbury^[Shaftesbury School, Shaftesbury, Dorset https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaftesbury_School] and Stockport^[St Anne's RC High School, Stockport, Manchester https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anne's_Roman_Catholic_High_School] before returning to higher education. As well as working in educational institutions around the UK I've been fortunate enough to teach in India, Japan and America too. üá¨üáßüáÆüá≥üáØüáµüá∫üá∏

## Background  {-}
Born in [Bath, Somerset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset) and raised using a [secret West Country recipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country), my [background](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull) is a mixture of Natural Sciences ([Plant Sciences, BSc](http://www.plantsciences.manchester.ac.uk/)), Computer Science ([MSc](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/msc2003.html) & PhD) and software engineering. I‚Äôve worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including [BBC Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring), the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS). While working on [Apache Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna) and [myGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid) I completed a [PhD](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578) at the University of Manchester. This was followed by a [postdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) at the [Manchester Institute of Biotechnology](http://www.mib.ac.uk/) (MIB) working on the [Refine project](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/) and a stint as a software engineer on [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) (ChEBI) in Cambridge, UK at the European Bioinformatics Institute ([ebi.ac.uk](https://www.ebi.ac.uk)). üá™üá∫

## Tools  {-}
This website^[last updated `r Sys.Date()`] is published using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) and built with [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [the R language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [knitr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitr), [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and TLC. Thanks to [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/) for the excellent tools and documentation. The [source is available on github](https://github.com/dullhunk/hulled), but you'll be better off reading the _friendly_ manual _[Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)_ first. If you're viewing this on an iPhone or iPad, there is [known bug with the menu bar at the top of this page](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/60) which means the menu might not display properly. I could have (should have?) used [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), but opted for bookdown because it is much ~~less bloated~~ easier to use. üî®
