# Hello! {-}

(ref:captionthisisme) This is me. Background photo by [slidebean](https://unsplash.com/@slidebean) on [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com), a source of [freely-usable images](https://unsplash.com/license).

Hello and welcome to the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). My name is Duncan and I'm a lecturer here with responsibility for managing our [Industrial Experience](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/) (IE) program. This elective course has [around 100](#employability) students every year working in paid employment for the penultimate (“sandwich”) year-in-industry of their undergraduate degrees. 🥪🎓

I [teach](#teaching) undergraduate & postgraduate courses, supervise tutorials & projects while serving as [employability tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/placement/). I'm interested in methods that can [improve teaching, learning and the student experience](#research) using techniques like [industrial mentoring](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/),  [journal clubbing](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), [working with local schools](#coding-their-future), [Wikipedia editing](#wikipedia), and [live music](#tuningcomplete). 🎸

If you are an [employer](#employers) who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please [get in touch](#contact). During term time, we edit and highlight some of the best opportunities for students in a weekly newsletter known as the [Wednesday Waggle](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about). 🐝

## Full stack teaching  {-}
Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary & secondary school children ([K--12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%9312)), undergraduates & postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a [Postgraduate Certificate in Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education) (PGCE) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) and worked as a high school science teacher in co-educational [non-selective state-funded schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-funded_schools_(England)) in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport before returning to higher education. As well as teaching in the UK I have been fortunate enough to teach in India, Japan and America too. 🇬🇧🇮🇳🇯🇵🇺🇸

## What's the story, coding glory?  {-}
Born in [Bath, Somerset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset) and raised using a [secret West Country recipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country), [my story](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull) is a mixture of Natural Sciences ([Plant Sciences, BSc](http://www.plantsciences.manchester.ac.uk/)), Computer Science ([MSc](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/msc2003.html) & PhD) and software engineering. I’ve worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including [BBC Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring), the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS). While working on [Apache Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna) and [myGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid) I completed a [PhD](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578) at the University of Manchester. This was followed by a [postdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) at the [Manchester Institute of Biotechnology](https://www.mib.manchester.ac.uk/) (MIB) working on the [Refine project](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/) and a stint as a software engineer of [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChEBI) (ChEBI) at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute) in Cambridge, UK. 🇪🇺

## Get a life!  {-}
When I get the time I like to [sing baritone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone), practice my [embarrassing dad dance](#tuningcomplete) moves, [look after bees](http://beelife.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and butcher the greek language, preferably on a beach in Greece. Άντε γειά! 🏖️🇬🇷
