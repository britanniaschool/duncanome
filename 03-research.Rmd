My research interests are in Computer Science Education (CSE) and [pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy). I am particularly interested in better [teaching and learning methods](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/teaching-learning/) that prepare students for the wide range of careers they go onto after graduation. This includes "hard" technical and "soft" non-technical skills.

## SIGCSE
In the UK we have only been teaching Computer Science to undergraduates [for 50 short years](http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/11/07/baby_computer_40_interview_feature.shtml), so there's lots of open questions about how to teach the practical and theoretical aspects of the subject.

* I'm an active member of the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) in Computer Science Education ([SIGCSE.org](https://sigcse.org)).
* As part of that I founded and chair a [journal club](https://duncan.hull.name/2019/07/17/sigcse-journal-club/) for educators in Manchester, if you'd like to join us, subscribe to the mailing list by emailing listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk with the text **subscribe sigcse-journal-club yourfirstname yoursecondname** in the body of your message
* I'm serving on the program committee for [Computing Education & Practice (CEP)](http://community.dur.ac.uk/cep.conference) at Durham University.

## Code Club
I lead an after school [CodeClub](https://codeclub.org), part of a global network of free coding clubs for 9--13 year olds. The aim is to have fun using scratch, python and other interesting technology we can get our hands on including [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Micro:bits](https://microbit.org/), [LEGO® MINDSTORMS®](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/mindstorms), [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com), [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and [CodeBug](http://www.codebug.org.uk/) etc.

## Wikipedia
Wikipedia (and its sister project [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org)) are great tools for improving digital skills and communication skills, regardless the learners level of computer literacy. As an experience and long serving editor of Wikipedia since 2004, I organise and participate in [edit-a-thons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon) which recruit and train new Wikipedia editors in collaboration with other volunteers.
