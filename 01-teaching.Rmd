# Students {#teaching}

During [term time](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/) I teach ðŸŽ“on a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses including:


## All years: debug your CV

* You can drop-in to my weekly CV clinics for Computer Science students in LF25 during term-time. Whatever stage you are at, it is a good idea to **debug** your CV, LinkedIn, job search, life etc before you show it to a potential employer. These sesions are open to undergraduate (BSc, BEng) and postgradautes (MSc and PhD). If you haven't written a CV, rÃ©sumÃ© or LinkedIn profile before, you might find the _Debug your CV_ guide useful at [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv). Outside of term time, you'll need to book an appointment.

I'm proud to have served as a judge of the fantastic [studenthack.com](https://www.studenthack.com) and [greatunihack.com](https://greatunihack.com) since they started in 2014. These [hackathons](https://medium.com/tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000) are organised by [UniCS](https://www.unicsmcr.com/), (formerly known as HackSoc and CSSoc).
