# Hello! {-}

Hello and welcome to the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). My name is Duncan and I'm a lecturer (≈ [Assistant Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor)) here with responsibility for managing our [Industrial Experience](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/) (IE) program. This elective course has [around 100](#employability) students every year working in paid employment for the penultimate (“sandwich”) year-in-industry of their undergraduate degrees. 🥪🎓

I [teach](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/teaching.html) undergraduate & postgraduate students, supervise tutorials & projects while serving as [employability tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/placement/). I'm interested in methods that can [improve teaching, learning and the student experience](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/research.html) using techniques like [coding your future](https://www.cdyf.me), [industrial mentoring](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/),  [journal clubbing](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), [working with local schools](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/coding-their-future.html), [Wikipedia editing](#wikipedia), and [live music](#tuningcomplete). 🎸

If you are an [employer](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/employers.html) who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please [get in touch](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/contact.html). During term time, we edit and highlight some of the best opportunities for students in a weekly newsletter known as the Wednesday Waggle [waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about) which goes out to over 1000 undergraduate and postgraduates in Computer Science. 🐝

## Full stack teaching  {-}
Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary & secondary school children ([K--12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%9312)), undergraduates & postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a [Postgraduate Certificate in Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education) (PGCE) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) and worked as a high school science teacher in co-educational [non-selective state-funded schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-funded_schools_(England)) in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport before returning to higher education. As well as teaching in the UK I have been fortunate enough to teach in India, Japan and America too. 🇬🇧🇮🇳🇯🇵🇺🇸

## What's the story? {-}
Born in [Bath, Somerset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset) and raised using a [secret West Country recipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country), [my story](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull) is a mixture of Natural Sciences ([Plant Sciences, BSc](https://speakerdeck.com/dullhunk/why-study-plants)), Computer Science ([MSc](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/msc2003.html) & [PhD](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578)) and software engineering. I’ve worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including [BBC Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring), the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS). I was part of the [Apache Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna) and [myGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid) projects before completing a [postdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) at the [Manchester Institute of Biotechnology](https://www.mib.manchester.ac.uk/) (MIB) on the [Refine project](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/). This was followed by a short stint as a software engineer of [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChEBI) (ChEBI) at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute) (EBI) in Cambridge, UK. 🧬🇪🇺

## Get a life!  {-}
When I get the time I like to [sing baritone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone), practice my [embarrassing dad dance](#tuningcomplete) moves, [look after bees](http://beelife.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and butcher the greek language, preferably on a beach in Greece. Άντε γειά! 🏖️🇬🇷
