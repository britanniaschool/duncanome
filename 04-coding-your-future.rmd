## Reading your future {#reading}

Coding your future is a guidebook and course is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While the guide supports undergraduate teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn’t actually matter:

* *where* in the world you are studying
* what *stage* of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
* what *level* you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
* what *institution* you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
* what *subject* you are studying, as long as you are **computationally curious**

*Coding your Future* has something for any student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👩🏿‍💻
