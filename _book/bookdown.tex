Hello, my name is Duncan. I'm a lecturer in the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{Department of Computer Science} at the \href{https://www.manchester.ac.uk}{University of Manchester} where I lead the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/}{Industrial Experience (IE)} program. This elective course has over 100 students per year working for 12 months in industry in the penultimate year of their degrees.

I \protect\hyperlink{teaching}{teach} undergraduate courses, supervise tutorials, final year projects and masters projects. I serve as \href{http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year2/}{second year tutor} and employability tutor. I'm interested in \protect\hyperlink{research}{better teaching and learning methods}, for example using innovative techniques like \protect\hyperlink{vertical-tutoring}{vertical tutoring} and \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/}{industrial mentoring} to improve student experience.

If you are an \protect\hyperlink{employers}{employer} who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please \protect\hyperlink{contact}{get in touch}. During term time, we highlight opportunities for students via the \href{https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about}{Wednesday Waggle}. üêù

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background}

My \href{https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull}{background} is a mixture of Natural Sciences (\href{http://www.plantsciences.manchester.ac.uk/}{Plant Sciences, BSc}), Computer Science (MSc \& PhD) and software engineering. I've worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring}{BBC Monitoring}, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company}{Ford Motor Company} and the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service}{National Health Service} (NHS). While working on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna}{Apache Taverna}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid}{myGrid} and \href{http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/}{Refine project} I completed a \href{https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578}{PhD} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher}{postdoc} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics}{Bioinformatics} at the University of Manchester. More recently, I was employed as a software engineer of a biochemical database (\href{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/}{Chemical Entities of Biological Interest: ChEBI}) in Cambridge, UK at the European Bioinformatics Institute (\href{https://www.ebi.ac.uk}{ebi.ac.uk}). üá™üá∫

I have taught english, maths, science and engineering from primary to postgraduate level and beyond. This has included work with primary \& secondary school children (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\%E2\%80\%9312}{K--12}), undergraduates \& postgraduates in the UK, India and America. üá¨üáßüáÆüá≥üá∫üá∏

  You can drop-in to my weekly one-to-one CV clinics for Computer Science students in LF25 during term-time. Whatever stage you are at, it is a good idea to \textbf{debug} your CV, LinkedIn, job search, life etc before you show it to a potential employer. These sesions are open to undergraduate (BSc, BEng) and postgradautes (MSc and PhD). If you haven't written a CV, r√©sum√© or LinkedIn profile before, you might find the \emph{Debug your CV} guide useful at \href{http://git.io/mycv}{git.io/mycv}. Outside of term time, you'll need to book an appointment.

\hypertarget{careers-fairs}{%

Our annual Computer Science careers fair is held the Kilburn building in autumn, we typically have around 30 employers exhibited over two days.

We also run drop-in sessions where employers can come in and set up a stand in the foyer to talk to students informally on their way to and from lectures, usually during lunch in \href{https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/}{term time}. If you're interested in exhibiting at either of these, please \protect\hyperlink{contact}{contact the careers and placements officer Mabel Yau}.

The central careers service also organises

Starting in September 2019, I am leading an experiment with a vertical tutoring system for undergraduate students. The idea is fairly widespread in secondary education (see \href{https://www.verticaltutoring.org/}{verticaltutoring.org}), but as far as we know has not been used fully in higher education.

Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) \href{http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk}{pass.manchester.ac.uk}, vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative from \emph{one of each} of several years and combined with alumni. For example, a vertical tutor group could contain:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One first year student
\item
  One second year student
\item
  One student out on placement
\item
  One final year student
\item
  One member of our alumni
