# Vertical tutoring

Starting in September 2019, I am leading an experiment with a vertical tutoring system for undergraduate students. The idea is fairly widespread in secondary education (see [verticaltutoring.org](https://www.verticaltutoring.org/)), but as far as we know has not been used fully in higher education.

Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) [pass.manchester.ac.uk](http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk), vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative from _one of each_ of several years and combined with alumni. For example, a vertical tutor group could contain:

* One first year student
* One second year student
* One student out on placement
* One final year student
* One member of our alumni  

## Full stack mentoring
This is a work in progress. Watch this space for updates!
