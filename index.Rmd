# Hello {-}

```{r unsplashed-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "66%", fig.cap = "Hello my name is Duncan, this is what I look like now (left) and when I was a longer-haired undergraduate (right). I'm a lecturer here in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester."}

Hello and welcome to the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). My name is Duncan and I'm a lecturer (≈ [Assistant Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor)) here with responsibility for managing our [Industrial Experience](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/) (IE) program. I [teach](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/teaching.html) undergraduate & postgraduate students, supervise tutorials & projects while serving as [industrial experience & employability tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/placement/). I'm interested in methods that can [improve teaching, learning and the student experience](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/research.html) by:

* Developing and delivering *Coding Your Future*: a course & guidebook for students at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me)
* Teaching engineers to [make better software](https://software-eng.netlify.app/) in collaboration with our [industrial mentors](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/)
* Updating students weekly on opportunities with the Wednesday waggle newsletter at [waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about)
* Improving students written communication skills by enabling them to start [writing their future](https://www.cdyf.me/writing.html)
* Engaging with a wide range of employers through [our industry club](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/)
* Growing and building the teaching community by journal clubbing at [sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/)
* Supporting local schools teaching computing by [coding their future](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/coding-their-future.html)

Our elective industrial experience program has [up to 100](#employability) students every year working in paid employment for the penultimate (“sandwich”) year-in-industry of their undergraduate degrees. If you are an [employer](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/employers.html) who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please [get in touch](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact.html). 🐝

## Full stack teaching  {-}
Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary & secondary school children, undergraduates & postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a [Postgraduate Certificate in Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education) (PGCE) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) and worked as a high school science teacher in co-educational [non-selective state schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school) in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport before returning to higher education. As well as teaching in the UK I have been fortunate enough to teach in India, Japan and America too. 🇬🇧🇮🇳🇯🇵🇺🇸

## What's the story? {-}
What's the story, Jackanory? Born in [Bath, Somerset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset) and raised using a [secret West Country recipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country), [my story](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull) is a mixture of Natural Science ([Plant Sciences, BSc](https://speakerdeck.com/dullhunk/why-study-plants)), Computer Science ([MSc](mastersofscience.html) & [PhD](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.497578)) and software engineering. Outside of academia, I’ve worked as a consultant and software developer for [BBC Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring), the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS). As an academic, I have been part of the [e-Science lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/), [Apache Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna) and [myGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid) projects before completing a [postdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) at the [Manchester Institute of Biotechnology](https://www.mib.manchester.ac.uk/) (MIB) on the [Refine project](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/). This was followed by a short stint as a software engineer of [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChEBI) (ChEBI) at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute) (EBI) in Cambridge, UK. 🧬🇪🇺

## Get a life!  {-}
When I get the time I like to [sing baritone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone) with [Tuning Complete](#tuningcomplete), [look after bees](http://beelife.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and butcher the greek language, preferably on a beach in Greece. Άντε γειά! 🏖️🇬🇷
