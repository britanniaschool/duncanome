## All years: Debug your CV {#allyears}

If you'd like to debug your CV, email me a copy of your CV, so that you can:

* Drop-in to my weekly one-to-one CV clinics for Computer Science students in LF25 during term-time during my open office hours: Mondays from 10am to midday in LF25 / Tootill 1.
* Get feedback on your CV from as many people as possible, because "[given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law)" [@Raymond1999]
* If you haven't written a CV (two pages), rÃ©sumÃ© (one page) or LinkedIn profile before, you might find the _Debug your CV_ guide useful at [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv). [@debugyourcv]

Outside of term time, it's best to book an appointment

* Course leader for *Coding your Future*, (COMP2CARS) a course designed by me for (primarily) second year students to design, build, test and debug their futures.

Previously I served as [second year tutor](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year2/) from 2016 through to 2020.

## Penultimate year students {#penultimate}

If you're on placement during your penultimate year, I serve as:

## Final year students {#finalyear}

If you're in your final year of study, you'll find me:

* Supervising final year educational projects based in secondary schools in Greater Manchester, see [coding their future](#coding-their-future). [@computinged]

## Masters {#masters}

If you're doing a Masters degree, you'll find me:

* Supervising [Master of Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/) projects in Computer Science and Data Science. [@r4ds] This usually involves various combinations of Wikipedia, Wikdata, [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) [@ducharme] and chatbots. ðŸ¤– [@myca]

## Extracurricular

Outside all of the above, I also get involved in:

* Organising, facilitating and promoting extra-curricular activities such as [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) [@Briscoe; @Warner2017] and [edit-a-thons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon). [@goodbadugly; @troubled; @findingada2019] These usually occur off-timetable, for example Wednesday afternoons, evenings and weekends.
* Judging competitions such as [studenthack.com](https://www.studenthack.com) and [greatunihack.com](https://greatunihack.com) since 2014. These two hackathons are organised by [UniCS](https://www.unicsmcr.com/), a student-led tech society formed by the merger of HackSoc (computer geekery) and CSSoc (socialising). Many other hackathons exist, they are usually aimed at beginners looking to learn new skills, rather than experts looking to compete. [@Briscoe; @hafb]
