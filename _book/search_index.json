["index.html", "Dr. Duncan Hull About Full stack teaching Background Tools", " Dr. Duncan Hull About Hello, my name is Duncan. I’m a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester where I lead the Industrial Experience (IE) program. This elective course has over 100 students every year working for 12 months in industry in the penultimate year of their degree. 🎓 I teach undergraduate courses, supervise tutorials, final year projects and masters projects. I serve as second year tutor, employability tutor, while also serving on the mitigating circumstances committee and the exam board. I’m interested in methods that can deliver high quality learning and student experience by using innovative techniques like vertical tutoring, industrial mentoring, live coding, Wikipedia editing and live / recorded music. 🎸 If you are an employer who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please get in touch. During term time, we highlight opportunities for students in the Wednesday Waggle. 🐝 Full stack teaching Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary &amp; secondary school children (K–12), undergraduates &amp; postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at the University of Bath and trained at co-educational non-selective state-funded schools in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport before returning to higher education. Teaching is a great way to travel, and its taken me around the UK, India and America. 🇬🇧🇮🇳🇺🇸 Background Born in Bath, Somerset and raised in the West Country, my background is a mixture of Natural Sciences (Plant Sciences, BSc), Computer Science (MSc &amp; PhD) and software engineering. I’ve worked as a consultant and software developer for various organisations including BBC Monitoring, the Ford Motor Company and the National Health Service (NHS). While working on Apache Taverna and myGrid I completed a PhD at the University of Manchester. This was followed by a postdoc at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB) on the Refine project and a stint as a software engineer on Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) in Cambridge, UK at the European Bioinformatics Institute (ebi.ac.uk). 🇪🇺 Tools This website is written in R markdown and built using bookdown, gitbook, JabRef, JavaScript, knitr, LaTeX, Pandoc, RStudio and Visual Studio Code.

According to highfliers.co.uk, the University of Manchester is the most targeted University in the UK by the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers. (Birchall 2019a, 2019b, 2019c) We can still do better, for example by engaging with a more diverse group of employers, especially those in Manchester and the Northern Powerhouse, see git.io/manc. (Hull 2019b) Figure 2.1: Any employer recruiting our students is welcome to join our industry club, see details below 2.1 Recruiting students If you are recruiting computer scientists and software engineers as a summer interns, placement students or as graduates please get in touch with me or Mabel Yau (careers and placements officer). We typically have around 250 undergraduate students graduating annually, alongside a smaller number of Masters and PhD students. The entry tariff of our students (A* AA including A* in mathematics) is comparable to other leading Computer Science (CS) departments in Russell Group universities as shown in the table below. Institute Entry tariff CS Students per year University of Cambridge A* A* A ~100 University College London A* A* A ~150 University of Manchester A* A A ~250 Imperial College London A* A A ~200 University of Oxford A* A A ~50 If you are looking to recruit science and engineering students from other disciplines like Physics, Maths, Chemistry, Mechnical, Aerospace &amp; Civil Engineering (MACE), Materials Science and Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering (EEE) you should talk to staff in those departments or the central careers service at careers.manchester.ac.uk 2.2 Careers fairs Our annual Computer Science careers fair is held in the Kilburn building in autumn, we typically have around 30 employers exhibiting over two days. As space is limited, we are always over-subscribed and are not able to accommodate every employer that our students will be interested in. The central careers service also organises: the big careers fair in Manchester Central every autumn, see the Big Careers Fair a smaller careers fair in Fallowfield Armitage centre in May hundreds of other employer events on campus during term time (Birchall 2019b) 2.3 Drop-in sessions If you aren’t able to exhibit at careers fairs, we also run ad-hoc drop-in sessions where employers can come in and set up a stand in the foyer to talk to computer science students informally on their way to and from lectures. These usually happen during lunch in term time. If you’re interested in exhibiting at either of these events, please contact the careers and placements officer Mabel Yau. 2.4 Industry Club All employers are welcome to join our industry club mailing list by sending an email to listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk with the the text subscribe cs-industryclub yourfirstname yoursecondname in the body of the email message. The industry club is part of our wider business engagement activities. The mailing list is low-traffic, typically two to three updates per year and an invitation to our annual industry club meeting. We promise not to spam you or sell your email details on to third parties. 2.5 Industrial mentoring The Industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers allows employers meet students during code review sessions. 2.6 The Wednesday Waggle 🐝 During term time, we highlight events and vacancies for Computer Science students from a wide range of sources in a weekly newsletter called the Wednesday Waggle. This goes out to around ~1000 Bachelors and Masters students in Manchester each week. If you have vacancies or events you would like our students to know about, get in touch with us or contact the careers service. 2.7 Buzzing! At peak times, we can get very busy with many concurrent employer events on campus. (Birchall 2019b) Please be patient and persistent if we do not reply immediately. Unfortunately, we are not always able to respond to everyone because our students, staff and space are all finite resources. We give priority to employers that have already given their time and expertise to our community.

(Biggs and Tang 2011) I’m interested in methods that can deliver high quality learning and student experience using innovative techniques like vertical tutoring, industrial mentoring, live music, live coding, Wikipedia editing and more. Figure 3.1: Too many educational practices are not backed up by good evidence that they actually work. More evidence is needed to support many of the claims made about effective pedagogy. Wikipedian Protester cartoon by Randall Munroe at xkcd.com/285 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License 3.1 SIGCSE Computer Science has only been taught to undergraduates in the UK for 50 short years (Brackenbury 2005), so there’s lots of open questions about how to teach both the practical and theoretical aspects of the subject. To that end: I’m an active member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE.org). As part of that I founded and chair a journal club for educators in Manchester, if you’d like to join us, subscribe to the mailing list by emailing listserv@listserv.manchester.ac.uk with the text subscribe sigcse-journal-club yourfirstname yoursecondname in the body of your message I’m serving on the program committee for Computing Education &amp; Practice (CEP) conference at Durham University in 2020. 3.2 Industrial mentoring Since we started the Industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers in 2015, more than 1000 students have been through the mentoring scheme with 250 students taking the course every year. We are very grateful for continued support from our industrial partners in making this happen. Mentors meet with a group of six second year students for two one hour meetings and do some gentle code review of their gitlab repository, as they start to fix bugs and add features to a large open source software project. You don’t need to be an expert in the tools students are using (Java, Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, JUnit and Ant) it is more about the general process (and politics) of building and testing high quality software in large and distributed teams, than the specifics of the codebase (https://stendhalgame.org/) we happen to be using. Mentors are typically software engineers, both junior and senior. 3.3 Vertical tutoring We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) scheme, see vertical tutoring for details. (Barnard 2010; Drury 2013) 3.4 Code Club I lead an after school CodeClub as part of a global network of free coding clubs for 9–13 year olds. (Smith, Sutcliffe, and Sandvik 2014) The aim is to have fun using scratch, (Resnick et al. 2009) python and other interesting technology we can get our hands on including Raspberry Pi, (Halfacree 2019) Micro:bits, (Sentance et al. 2017) LEGO® MINDSTORMS®, (Papert 1980, @Klassner2003) Oculus Rift, Sonic Pi (Aaron, Blackwell, and Burnard 2016) and CodeBug etc. 3.5 Wikipedia Wikipedia and wikidata.org (Vrandečić and Krötzsch 2014; Turki et al. 2019) are powerful tools for improving both digital skills and communication skills, regardless of your age or level of computer literacy.

["vertical-tutoring-1.html", "4 Vertical tutoring 4.1 Full stack mentoring 4.2 What is it good for? 4.3 How long will all this take?", " 4 Vertical tutoring We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) system for undergraduate students. VT is already widespread in secondary education, (Barnard 2010; Drury 2013) but as far as we know has not been widely used in higher education. Extending the idea of Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) pass.manchester.ac.uk, vertical tutoring creates tutorial groups with a representative from one of each year of undergraduate study combined with alumni. Figure 4.1: Conventional horizontal tutor groups (shown in black) bring together a group of students in the same year. For example, year 1 students meet as a small group once per week during term time with their tutor. Vertical tutor groups (shown in red) are made of of one student from each year and an alumni. Vertical tutor groups extend the idea of PASS, to full stack mentoring, crossing all levels 4.1 Full stack mentoring A vertical tutor group will typically contain five members as shown in Figure~??. The group meets physically where possible, or virtually via a slack channel which consists of: One first year student One second year student One penultimate year student (out on industrial placement) One final year student (returned from placement or summer internship) One member of our alumni, recent graduate or via network.manchester.ac.uk Vertical tutor groups meet twice per semester. It is very unlikely that a free timetable slot for all years and alumni can be found during normal office hours, because of the complexities of timetabling. So evenings will be likely to work best. Where possible, tutor groups will meet face to face, with remote members (e.g. placement students and alumni) typically joining virtually by slack or similar. 4.2 What is it good for? Vertical tutoring is an attractive idea but does it actually work? If so, how? What is it useful for? We would like to find out: If there is any appetite for vertical tutoring amongst students and alumni How it could work e.g. with slack.com or discord etc? How many times can/should vertical tutor groups meet? Twice per semester? More frequently? Less frequently? What are suitable topics for discussion in a vertical tutorial? Careers, wellbeing, networking etc What kind of specialist groups could be useful e.g. all female groups, research focussed tutorial groups (with MSc &amp; PhD students), ordinary “vanilla” groups etc How much can we breakdown entrenched year groups that persist throughout education (Robinson 2006) What might the benefits be? (Robinson 2010) As this is an experiment, students have been selected on a voluntary basis. If you’re a student or former student and would like to get involved, let me know. 4.3 How long will all this take? We ask that tutees commit to: two one hour sessions per semester some setup and administration, slack channels, scheduling suitable times and dates with your group Two hours of time for feedback and review after each semester, by email survey References "],
["coding-their-future.html", "5 Coding their future 5.1 Guidance for teachers 5.2 Guidance for students", " 5 Coding their future Coding their future is a collaboration &amp; partnership between secondary schools and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. Our aim is to improve and support Computer Science education at key stages 3, 4 and 5. (Furber 2012, 2017; Sentance, Barendsen, and Schulte 2018; Swan et al. 2013) Figure 5.1: Undergraduate students in computer science regularly work with schools as part of our wider social responsibility activities (Rothwell 2011) The University provides schools with a final year student who can teach Computer Science in your school or college as a teaching assistant (TA). In return, the school provides our undergraduate students with a safe and supportive environment in which to teach which extends and augments your current curriculum. This can either be an after school, extension / lunchtime club or during scheduled lesson time, typically between year 7 and 13. This is similar to the Undergraduate Ambassador Scheme (UAS), (Singh 2005; Cooper and D’Inverno 2005) except students work is assessed using our final year project framework. (Morris 2019a, 2019b) Since these projects were started in 2012, our students have worked with a range of schools in the private and public sector, both selective and non-selective, co-educational and single-sex including: Fairfield High School for Girls, Droylsden University Technical College (UTC) \\(@\\)MediaCityUK, Salford Manchester Communication Academy, Harpurhey The Barlow RC High School, Didsbury Cheadle Hulme High School, Stockport Knutsford Academy, Knutsford Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Trafford Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Trafford Manchester Grammar School, Fallowfield The projects were setup by Duncan Hull and David Rydeheard (who retired in 2019), and are now run and supervised by Duncan. We hope to transfer ideas between private and public sector, as there are lots of open questions about how Computer Science should be taught. (Sentance, Barendsen, and Schulte 2018; Sentance 2018; Stephenson 2018) To find out more, see guidance for teachers and guidance for students below. 5.1 Guidance for teachers Figure 5.2: An abundance of free software and relatively cheap new hardware like the Raspberry Pi (Halfacree 2019), Microbit, (Sentance et al. 2017) and Arduino (Banzi and Shiloh 2015) has opened up lots of new possibilities for teaching Computer Science. Picture via Alex Bate. (Bate 2019) Our aim is to support the teaching and learning of Computer Science in your school and to help engage schoolchildren in the subject. This page describes what we can provide you with and what we expect to get in return. 5.1.1 What the University is offering your school The University of Manchester will provide your school or college with at least one student ambassador with some relevant training who has completed two years of study in Computer Science and has: A good knowledge of, and enthusiasm for Computer Science Completed Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) clearance An interest in teaching and working with young people Achieved a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st class degree in their second year 5.1.2 What the University expects from your school In return, we expect that the school provides the undergraduate student with: Opportunities to engage with a classroom or after school club of children as a Teaching Assistant (TA). This is typically for around one or two hours during term time. Initially, this could be through classroom observation and teacher assistance, culminating in the student delivering at least one lesson (and potentially a series of lessons) with your support and guidance Advice, suggestions, feedback, assessment and encouragement from you to suggest the kinds of resources that would be useful, appropriate or engaging for the Computer Science curriculum you are teaching Classroom and behaviour management: the students are not trained teachers and will be relying on your expertise in classroom and behaviour management. 5.1.3 Resources developed by students Undergraduates typically develop a range of resources. The project will involve development of a computer-based system together with supporting activities, lessons and resources. The resource could be a variety of things including, a game, robotics, animations, hardware (Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc) or software, intended to enthuse school students at one of the Key stages 3 or 4 about fundamental concepts in computing preferably linked to one of the new Computer Science curricula. 5.1.4 Project timing The projects run for 6 months from September to March, divided into three phases. September to October Observation in the classroom teaching by the student around once per week. Development of ideas for an educational tool that the student will make, with the advice of the classroom teacher November to January From November to January, our students develop and tests prototype tool (or tools) with the supporting material, this can happen sooner for students who make a quick start to the project. February to April From February to April, our students are expected to liaise closely with teachers to develop an educational tool that will be of use in the classroom using teachers’ suggestions as to what is appropriate to build. Students will spend some time in a classroom working closely with teachers and students developing and delivering a new resource for teaching. More details on final year projects can be found in COMP300, the undergraduates already know what is required from their project 5.1.5 Assessment and monitoring Formal supervision and mentoring is undertaken by the university (Duncan and David), but we will ask you to fill in a one page form on your assessment of their progress during their time at your school, we very much value your input and hope that these projects can beneficial for both your school and the University. We don’t want to burden you with unnecessary bureaucracy that all teachers battle with! 5.2 Guidance for students Figure 5.3: A lecture theatre full of first year students So why would you, an undergraduate student, want to work on an education project in secondary school? The UK government would like Computer Science should be taught in all secondary schools in the UK. (Furber 2017) However, in many UK schools there is a shortage of teachers who are trained in Computer Science, consequently, many teachers find themselves being asked to teach a subject they may know little about. (Furber 2012) Undergraduate students can make a significant difference here, by supporting teachers in the classroom to create and deliver new classroom resources in Computer Science. (Hull 2019a) In addition, undergraduate students will have the chance to: develop leadership skills in the classroom gain valuable experience of working on “real world” problems in a stimulating environment improve your communication skills, especially spoken communication work as part of a team (in the school) and join a small group of like-minded undergraduate students (in the University) working on related projects test your knowledge &amp; technical ability in a challenging and dynamic environment working with young people last, but not least, there is a good chance you will have lots of fun and have a rewarding experience of teaching make yourself more employable by doing all of the above 5.2.1 Who is involved? Initially, the number of undergraduate students involved in these projects will be less than ten. We also require that you will have a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st in your second year exams. Projects are co-supervised by Duncan with additional supervision from an experienced member of teaching staff at a participating school. We have carefully selected schools in Manchester that are relatively easy for you to get to, are already teaching Computer Science and have supportive staff and teachers in place to help you. You will be expected to work directly with school children with the support of the teaching staff in your school. Schools we have worked with are all the Manchester area. 5.2.2 What will the educational projects be expected to deliver? You will be expected to work closely with the teacher to develop resources that engage students with one or more aspects of the new Computer Science curriculum at an appropriate key stage. This is usually key stage 3, key stage 4 or key stage 5 ages 11-18. complement the schools current provision for computer science in the school During the project you will be spending a significant amount of time in the classroom, visiting your school every week during school term time throughout the duration of your project to develop resources. These must include a computer-based teaching tool which may use, for example, Raspberry Pi’s, visual aids, demonstrations, videos, online questionnaires, formative feedback, games, drones, robotics, music, (Aaron, Blackwell, and Burnard 2016) and algorithms (Kubica 2012) etc. In addition, guidance on classroom use, such as a lesson or series of lessons to support the tool. Remember that you don’t actually need a computer, see Computer Science Unplugged: Computer Science without a Computer. (Bell and Vahrenhold 2018) All deliverables for standard final year projects will be expected of these projects including: first semester presentation demonstration of the resource being used in the classroom final written report Assessments for these projects will be as for standard projects, (Morris 2019a, 2019b) but part of the evaluation of the project will be a classroom demonstration, a description and evaluation of which should be included in your final report. 5.2.3 When do the projects start and finish? Projects start annually in September and are handed at Easter time, see final year project guidelines. For more information contact Duncan Hull. References "],
