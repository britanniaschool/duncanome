# Employers {#employers}

We work with a wide range of employers from the bedroom startup to the worlds largest multi-national corporations, and are always looking for more organisations that can offer our students a stimulating environment to work in. According to [highfliers.co.uk](https://www.highfliers.co.uk), the University of Manchester is one of the most targeted Universities in the UK by the [Times Top 100 Graduate Employers](https://www.top100graduateemployers.com). We can do better, for example, by engaging more with new employers, especially those in Manchester (see [git.io/manc](https://git.io/manc)).
